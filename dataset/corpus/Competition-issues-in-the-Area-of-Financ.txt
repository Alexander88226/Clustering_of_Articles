After  describing  the current situation of this ecosystem the services the market the users    perception and the providers  of  FinTech  services  the  study  focuses  on  analysing  potential  anticompetitive factors and their impact both in the FinTech ecosystem as a whole and in concrete services categories. The area of FinTech is still very young and constantly evolving. This is why an established  case  practice  of  how  to  deal  with  competition  concerns  has  not  yet  been developed and official decisions by competition authorities have still to emerge. The FinTech services FinTech services offer significant potential benefits to European consumers such as cost reduction improvements in efficiency greater transparency and a contribution to the goal of financial inclusion. FinTech has come to revolutionise the way in which traditional financial services providers work and interact with their customers. It is changing the dominant paradigms by which traditional financial services are provided resulting in a significant disruption. Given  the  rapid  evolution  of  FinTech  services  there  is  no  consensus  on  a  standard classification. In this study the following categories are proposed which encompass the FinTech services currently provided (1) Banking    deposits and lending    (2) Payments Transfers and Forex (3) Digital currencies (4) Wealth and Asset Management (5) Personal Finance (6) InsurTech and (7) Enabling technologies and infrastructures. The FinTech market The difficulties defining the exact scope of FinTech services make it challenging to quantify the size of the current and potential market. An additional difficulty is the complexity of differentiating FinTech services provided by traditional firms in the financial sector from other services. As a result there are no estimates of turnover for FinTech services (considering all the services analysed in this study) as a whole in Europe at the moment. The FinTech users Some sources estimate that the average percentage of digitally active consumers using FinTech services in 2017 was 33 %. In Europe the UK and Spain are the countries with the highest share of FinTech users with 41 % and 37 % respectively. Germany with 35 % is the third European country above the global average. Globally FinTech services related to  payments  and  transfers  showed  the  highest  penetration  among  users  (50 %) followed by insurance (24 %) savings and investments (20 %) financial planning (10 %) and borrowing (10 %). FinTech  is  considered  to  have  an enormous  potential  in  improving  financial inclusion. FinTech  services  have  the  capacity  of  providing  more  easily  accessible  and  affordable financial services to large masses of the population and small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) especially in the area of credits and payments. PE 619.027 11  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  Besides  financial  inclusion  it  is  no  surprise  that  improving  user experience  is  at  the heart of the conceptual design of FinTech services. In fact in 2016 37 % of Europeans expressed their willingness to switch their financial services provider if it does not offer advanced  technology  services  or  products.  Unlike  what  happens  with  other  digitalised services  digital  skills  and  access  to  technology  are  not  the  only  factors  influencing  the penetration  of  FinTech  services.  Trust  is  a  key  element  of  all  financial  services  and  is equally in FinTech. The FinTech providers According to the Crunchbase database there are more than 3 850 FinTech service providers in the world. The EU ranks 2nd in number of services providers after the US with more than 1 000 FinTech companies. Enabler companies are the most frequent followed by providers of banking services. The level of investments in the sector provides a good overview of the relevance of FinTech services in different regions. The US leads the ranking accounting for some USD 29 billion of total investments followed by far by China the UK and India as shown in  Figure 14. The EU (excluding the UK) ranks 5th accounting for USD 3.6 billion. European companies (including the UK) are smaller with a larger number of microenterprises with less than 10 employees. European FinTech companies (excluding the UK) are also younger with an average age of 6.5 years compared to 9.8 in the US and 8.5 in India. In the EU and the US the percentage of FinTech companies that have been acquired is much higher than in other markets. It suggests that currently market exit of startup FinTech companies in the EU mainly happens through acquisitions. Companies in Europe are likely to be acquired by larger firms to complement their current offering. This fact  leads  to  the  need  for  a  close  monitoring  on  the  acquiring  of  firms  to  avoid anticompetitive behaviours. We have also analysed the relationship between the acquiring companies and the acquired companies and concluded there is a strong geographical endogamy. European companies are  acquired  by  European  companies  and  US  companies  are  mainly  acquired  by  US companies. Competition issues in the FinTech sector Most  of  the  potential  competition  issues  in the  FinTech  sector  described  throughout  the study have not occurred    or have not been detected by competition authorities    so far. Thus the discussion about the competition problems is still hypothetical; however it is necessary  to  analyse  where  competition  concerns  may  arise  and  how  they  should  be addressed as they may materialise in the future. The application of competition instruments to analyse potential anticompetitive behaviours in the FinTech sector faces several challenges the most relevant being the difficulty in applying  these  traditional  instruments  to  the  new  market  phenomena  such  as market definition and assessment of market power. Traditional indicators such as market shares prices or profit margins fail to explain the economic relationships between offer and demand  in  the  provision  of  FinTech  services.  Missing  a  stable  market  any  analysis  of competition is bound to be tentative since competition challenges could unfold in different directions depending on what turns out to be the decisive factor that provides a competitive advantage.    12 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) Commonalities in FinTech competition challenges A servicebyservice approach based on the business model of each service category has been used to explain the competition issues. This should not obscure the fact however that  there  are  strong  commonalities1  in  FinTech  competition  challenges  that  go beyond a particular service or operator. Common competition challenges have been analysed taking into account two perspectives      The supplyside perspective with two categories of technology that have great influence in explaining competition challenges online platforms and the intensive use of data.      The  demandside  perspective  which  refers  to  the  way  users  access  and operate  FinTech  technologies  and  their  behaviour  and  perception  of  FinTech technologies as a means to deliver financial services. The  use  of  multisided  online  platforms  to  provide  FinTech  services  implies  that  the definition of the relevant market cannot be undertaken following traditional models built on the premises of pipeline businesses where value is generated by the supplier of a product or a service. In the case of platforms the value or a large part of it is generated by the users on the other side. The second competition challenge resulting from the combination of platform dynamics and users    perception and behaviour is the generation of network effects. FinTech platforms are not as regulated as financial trading platforms and therefore the challenges arising from network effects need to be assessed as a competition challenge. These challenges include the risk that multisided network effects enable a large platform to be insulated from competition from smaller platforms with fewer participants and can create barriers of entry. Other factors may be at play that modulate the intensity and features of the network effects and their influence on the potential competition issues. It is particularly relevant whether users tend to choose only one provider (   single homing   ) or several providers (   multihoming   ). Network effects increase with the intensity of use and the singlehoming nature of the platforms.  Interoperability is another potential anticompetitive factor related to platforms. An active pursuit of noninteroperability can act as a deterrence with anticompetitive effects if access to the market is difficult or costly. Standardisation  also  plays  a  relevant  role  in  the field  of  competition  between FinTech providers. If standardisation lowers entry costs and prices and/or allows firms to compete on more core parts of the service then it has a positive effect. However standardisation may  also  result  in  an  oligopoly  where  providers  may  take  the  opportunity  to  agree  on features of the service to split the market between them. Access  to  data  may  become  another  competition  issue  in  the  FinTech  ecosystem. Therefore the role of data to establish a competitive advantage needs to be borne in mind as  one  of  the  elements  involved  in  assessing  the  competitive  position  of  the  company resulting from a merger. Control over unique data troves resulting from the combination of datasets from multiple sources should also be one of the main factors considered when assessing  potentially  anticompetitive  behaviours.  They  can  result  in  for  example exclusionary conduct when not allowing competitors to access data the conclusion of exclusive contracts if the incumbent uses its control over a particularly valuable dataset to create a network of contracts that forecloses competition or tying and bundling of services leveraging the firm   s position and imposing the use of other services.                                           1   Explained in section 3.1. PE 619.027 13  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  Computer algorithms themselves may also result in anticompetitive practices. They may do  so  in  a  way  that  promotes  express  and  tacit  collusion  because  they  can  learn  by themselves  and  conclude  that  the  best  way  to  maximise  profits  is  to  develop  collusive practices. Specific competition issues of each FinTech category Banking The  main  obstacle  for  the  development  of  a  competitive  market  is  not  due  to  existing anticompetitive  behaviours  in  the  market  but  a  lack  of  clear  regulatory  standards. Banking platform markets are primarily multihome and do not have a high intensity of use so potential anticompetitive factors might not have a real impact on competition at this stage. Payments transfers and Forex Payments  are  the  FinTech  services  that  competition  authorities  are  paying  the  most attention to. Relevant concerns that could lead to diminishing competition in the provision of payment services include access to critical assets such as data and mobile near field communication (NFC) chips and the use of an incumbency position gained offline to engage in exclusionary conduct towards competitors. Digital currencies The market for digital currencies is characterised by competition between currencies (intercryptocurrency  market)  and  competition  between  exchanges (intracryptocurrency market). While each submarket namely mining exchanges wallets and payments is subject to diverse dynamics which may result in different competition issues there are also common factors among them. One of the most relevant is the presence of network  effects.  Another  potential  anticompetitive  factor  is  the  standardisation  of distributed  ledger  technology  (DLT)  and  other  technical  protocols.  Private  or  public consortia agreements in relation to technical standards may affect the market entry or have an impact on current costs. Denial  of  access  to  the  gateways  of  traditional  banking  activities  such  as  payment systems  for  bank  account  transfers  or  card  processor  schemes  is  also  a  potential anticompetitive behaviour. The arrival of permissioned cryptocurrencies promoted by banks even by central banks will reshape the current competition level in the cryptocurrency market broadening the number of competitors. However the market power of banks in traditional banking services might be used to limit competition in the cryptocurrency market through preemptive acquisitions or predatory pricing schemes. Wealth and Asset management The  potential  competition  challenges  in  this  area  involve  the  fee  policies  of  different service  providers  the  blurring  of  boundaries  between  different  types  of  services (information advisory management) and the implications of the use of algorithms. The last one is an issue that looks more promising from a competition policy perspective. The effects of the use of algorithms in the provision of FinTech wealth management services is mixed. On the one hand there are procompetitive effects such as increased transparency on both price and quality variables as well as a more efficient development of products and services. On the other hand there are also risks for competition such as the potential role of algorithms to be facilitating factors for coordination and collusion (algorithmic collusion).    14 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) Personal Finance management Competition  issues  regarding  digital  Personal  Finance  management  (PFM)  services  arise mainly in the field of customer data access. Insurance Access to customers    data and the impact of algorithms on pricing strategies are the main factors that can lead to anticompetitive practices. The standardisation of private blockchains  might  also  create  barriers  of  entry  if  the  standardisation  process  lacks  the required transparency. Enabling technologies and infrastructures There are no specific competition concerns in technologies such as DLTs Artificial Intelligence  (AI)  and  Data  Analytics  apart  from  the  common  ones  (standardisation network effects access data). There are some specific niches of cybersecurity technologies where market concentration and potential competition concerns might occur. The advanced cloud services market is dominated by a small number of big tech companies and furthermore the barriers for new actors to access this market are huge. Conclusions The current state of the markets for FinTech services is generally too fluid to reach firm conclusions on the existence of competition challenges that need the deployment of competition tools on a largescale basis. The special role of regulation in the field of financial services sends a message of caution about the appropriateness of competition policy tools as the preferred means to address every challenge. FinTech services as part of the digital economy share potential competition challenges with other digital businesses mainly those derived from the provision of services through digital platforms and the access to customer data. Thus the remarks regarding competition in the digital environment remain valid in the FinTech ecosystem. PE 619.027 15  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  1.  THE FINTECH MARKET      FinTech financial  services  provided to revolutionise  the  way  in  which  traditional  financial  services  providers  work  and interact with their customers.  technology  have  come KEY FINDINGS through      FinTech  providers  include  three  types  of  stakeholders  (1)  newcomers  to  the sector  such  as  startups  offering  new  services  or  products;  (2)  traditional financial services providers or incumbents; and (3) technological companies that develop tools services and products in the field.      Competition issues affecting FinTech services depend on the specific characteristics of each service. FinTech services have been categorised as follows (1) banking; (2)  payments  transfers  and  Forex;  (3)  digital  currencies;  (4)  wealth  and asset management; (5) PFM; (6) InsurTech; and (7) enabling technologies and infrastructures.       There is no clear classification of the FinTech sector. The blurred definition of the FinTech concept makes it difficult to quantify the size of the current and potential market.       FinTech can play a relevant role in improving financial inclusion providing more accessible  and  affordable  financial  services.  Current  users  also  expect  to  receive better and more efficient financial services with the benefits of digitisation.       There is an underlying tension between improving accessibility and usability of financial  services  through  technology  and  assuring  consumer  trust  which  is essential for the functioning and stability of the financial system.          The US is the most relevant player among FinTech service providers followed by the EU. Within the EU the UK is by far the largest contributor to FinTech accounting for 45% of all EU companies. China and India are also becoming relevant actors. In mature and developed markets FinTech companies tend to be smaller and more focused on providing added value to existing financial services. In less mature financial markets such as China and India FinTech startups on average receive  much  higher  levels  of  financing  and  often  become  listed  companies suggesting that these firms are filling the existing gap  by  becoming  relevant providers of financial services themselves.      There  is  a  strong  geographic  endogamy  in  acquisitions  of  FinTech  services suggesting that specificities of the markets (regulation availably of services and consumer profiles) make it difficult for FinTech companies to provide their services at a global scale.   The European financial context 1.1.

Furthermore FinTech services may also contribute to the achievement of some of the most relevant European Union objectives such as the Digital Single Market the action plan for  consumers     financial  services3  and  the  Capital Markets Union.  These  services  also provide innovation4 to the market by bringing about the application of new business models and technologies to financial services.

FinTech adoption provides major impacts on the financial industry lowering barriers to entry  by  eliminating  physical  branches  and large  organisational  structures; disintermediating the current value chains; introducing new business models based on platforms and sharing economies; and providing a more efficient provision of services. For decades the financial  industry has massively used information and communications technologies  (ICT)  in  all  its  internal  processes  (backend).  More  recently  with  the emergence  of  the  internet  ICT  have  enabled  banks  to  offer  online  services  to  their customers both from fixed and mobile devices. By January 2018 51 % of European adults used  internet  banking5  doubling  since  2007  when  it  was  only  25 %  with  substantial differences6 across age country and education level.  FinTech has come to revolutionise the way in which traditional financial services providers work and interact with their customers. It is changing the dominant paradigms with which traditional financial services are provided resulting in a real disruption in terms of applicable business models and potentially in a growing market share. This is the case for example of loans where assets (loans) are traditionally financed in the bank's balance sheet through their own capital and liabilities (deposits and wholesale financing). The new scenario consists of the disintermediation of these activities by means of peertopeer (P2P) lending platforms in which the assets and liabilities disappear from the  balance  sheets  of  the  new  FinTech  companies  and  their  work  becomes  the intermediation between lenders investing in every individual loan borrowed. They use very  novel  credit  scoring techniques  based  on  AI  big  data  or  social  crowdscoring.  The appearance of this new type of intermediation has been accompanied in some countries7 by the regulation of alternative financing8 allowing the emergence of new FinTech P2P lending companies. More recently with the entry into force of the new Payment Services Directive (PSD2)9 FinTech services providers will be able to start developing new hitherto unknown models based  on  the  online  platform  business  models.  FinTech  providers  enable  the                                           3   European Commission (2017b). 4   European Commission (2018).   5   Eurostat (2018). 6   Eurostat  (2018).     Internet  banking  is  particularly  popular  among  25  to  34  year  olds  with  68%  using  this facility. The use of internet banking tends to increase in line with the education level of the user. While only 24% of those with low education use ebanking 77 % of those with high education use this service. Among EU Member States internet banking is most common in Denmark (where 90 % of people aged 16 to 74  said  they  were  using  it)  and  the  Netherlands  (89 %)  followed  by  the  other  Nordic  countries    Finland (87 %) and Sweden (86 %). The lowest shares were registered in Bulgaria (5 %) and Romania (7 %). Less than 30 % of those between the ages of 16 and 74 use internet banking in Greece (25 %) and Cyprus (28 %).   . 7   CrowdfundingHub (2016 p. 9). 8   European Commission (2018a). 9   European Commission.

PE 619.027 17  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  disintermediation of banking activities with respect to their clients by offering financial products  without  being  a  bank  or  providing  standard  banking  services  by  linking  their platforms  to  their  customers'  bank  accounts  such  as  the  origination  of  payments  or transfers. Likewise thanks to PSD2 FinTech companies operating under the concept of a PFM or aggregator can act as the financial portal for their clients adding and processing customer banking data so that they can offer thirdparty financial products. Companies can do this by means of accessing the information and data contained in each client's bank account(s). In this way the financial assets and liabilities of the clients i.e. their loans and deposits will remain within financial institutions and clients will have no need to accede to these institutions  because  they  will  always  interact  with  them  through  their  FinTech  service providers such as PFMs. In this sense PFM acts as a trusted and independent manager of client finances without being part of any bank or having any commercial dependence on them.  To  this  end  FinTech  providers  must  negotiate  their  application  programming interfaces  (APIs)  with  customers     banks  and  determine  the  prices  for  use  along  with establishing appropriate cybersecurity measures. Another significant segment of financial business being disrupted by FinTech is the financial advice on investments provide to customers through tools known as roboadvisors. These roboadvisors supply investment advice    in particular in the activities of asset allocation in portfolios selection of assets or investment funds and the execution and liquidation of orders all in an automated and online way substituting the staff of the traditional entities the client would normally refer to. The roboadvisors employ sophisticated algorithms even with AI for these tasks in order to offer real time solutions. Other  innovations  with  a  relevant  impact  in  the  financial  sector  are  the  new cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin which are digital currencies that operate in a decentralised way  by  means  of  P2P  technologies  like  blockchain  and  without  participation  or supervision by any central bank or institution. These cryptocurrencies offer technological and operational paradigms that are a source of disruption for the entire sector including monetary policy and financial stability.  All  these  disruptive  and  innovative  applications  utilise  new  and  emerging  technologies among  which  those  stand  out  are  AI  cloud  computing  biometrics  digital  identity blockchain cybersecurity RegTech internet of things (IoT) augmented reality etc.  These technologies are being developed or used in the financial sector by three types of stakeholders (1) newcomers to the sector that are mainly startups offering services or products  that  have  both  a  financial  and  a  technological  background;  (2)  traditional financial services providers or incumbents such as banks insurers or brokers; and (3) technological  companies  that  develop  tools  services  and  products  for  the  financial sector  that  enable  the  provision  of  FinTech  services  or  allow  the  companies  to  provide these services themselves.  In  this  environment  new  agents particularly  tech  startups  are  generally  able  to  offer financial services for lower costs and at a higher efficiency than the incumbents due to the lack of legacy infrastructures or organisations and the ability to better take advantage of innovations. It is also generally understood that they can offer better user experiences which poses significant challenges to other agents especially traditional financial service providers.  The traditional financial sector is restructuring itself after the financial crisis  1.1.2. The financial sector faces two simultaneous changes predominantly from the point of view of incumbents (1) the changes provoked by the financial crisis and its consequences on  18 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) restructuring business and balance sheets as well as the new regulations oriented to prevent future crises and to limit their effects on the whole economy; and (2) the need to adapt business models to the FinTech revolution through a digital transformation of the traditional business models.  These  changes  have  resulted  in  relevant  challenges  for  stakeholders  particularly incumbents. For instance the European Central Bank (ECB) points out the challenges faced by European banks are low profitability; the impact of digitalisation; low interest rates;  dealing  with  overcapacity  and  fragmentation;  cleaning  up  their  nonperforming loans; stronger regulation; and the Brexit process10. Oliver Wyman11 also identifies  the  agenda  for  European  banks  consisting  of  the  following  key  actions responding to changing buying behaviour related to digital opportunities; upgrading legacy  systems  and  processes; financial  resource  efficiency; consolidation opportunities; building workforce skills; and offering solutions to social challenges. The banking sector is still restructuring itself after the financial crisis. The European Banking Federation  (EBF)  reports  that  the  number  of  credit  institutions  in  the  EU28  has consistently fallen for the past eight years12 in a row and last year the number of banks decreased by 453 to 6 596 banks13 from 8 525 in 2008 a total decline of 6 %. Germany is home to more than 25 % of all the banks in the EU. Concentration could increase the efficiency and scale of European banks. This  opens  new  opportunities  to  new  entrants  not  affected  by  the  same  rules  as incumbents.  Still  nowadays  the banking  sector  seems  to  be  too  large  for new  FinTech companies to capture just a small fraction of it; banking is a business of managing huge financial assets for all the participating members of any economy. As the EBF reports by the end of 201614 the total amount of deposit liabilities held in EU banks amounted to EUR 22.1 trillion which was a 0.7 % drop from the previous year. Moreover the total value of outstanding loans from EU banks amounted to EUR 23.6 trillion an increase of 0.3 %.  increasing 1.1.3. Bank  adoption  of  FinTech  and  digital  transformation     open  innovation    ecosystems As the EBF points out there is a wide and enthusiastic adoption of the online and mobile banking and payment services among customers. This trend has reduced the importance of widespread physical bank branch networks. According to EBF during 2016 in the EU28 countries European credit institutions continued to experience a contraction of their main infrastructures  and  human  resources  which  was  a  trend  of  the  previous  years15  a reduction  of  4.6 %  of their  branches  (a  20.4 % compared  to  2008)  and  a  reduction  of 1.75 % of their workforce (a 16.4 % compared to 2008). All incumbents have now embarked on digital transformation processes. The following priorities  are  often  cited  regarding  engagement  in  this  digital  transformation  process adopting new Information Technologies (IT) architectures and technologies as biometric cloud AI or big data; offering an excellent customer experience; increasing digital sales; developing new business models; stimulating a more innovative workforce and working as                                           10   Lautenschl  ger S.

As  part  of  their  strategic  initiatives  many  European  incumbent  banks  are  developing FinTech  ecosystems  under  the  paradigm  of     open  innovation     which  combines technology customers and regulatory compliance around innovation and business models. This paradigm involves a bank meeting with startups and learning from them about their technologies  business  model  methodologies  and  cultures.  In  this  open  innovation ecosystem the startup and the bank agree to develop tests and trials all with the required regulatory compliance using the bank   s data and clients as proofs of concept to determine the future of the financial industry. Other incumbents have venture capital instruments to invest in FinTech startups besides other direct participations in the capital of new FinTech firms. Also big tech companies are investing in FinTech and in greater amounts since they do not face the same risk compliance issues as traditional financial providers. Challenger banks and neobanks 1.1.4. In banking services the FinTech innovations also manifest with the rise of the socalled challenger banks and neobanks which are becoming a global movement. According to the consultancy KPMG16    challenger banks can be established firms     most likely midsize or specialist     that seek to compete with larger institutions. Neobanks17 tend to be newer completely digital mobile but there   s some overlap   . Both innovative types of banks have common ground as they both use new technology platforms without carrying inefficient and  oldfashioned  legacy  systems  cumbersome  organisational  structures  and  large branches base. Challenger banks are popping up worldwide and they constitute a potential opportunity for a faster increase in the provision of crossborder banking services across Europe. They can also be a tool for financial inclusion as they do not require deploying physical branches and are less hampered by regulation due to the fact that they do not provide a full range of financial services.  As KPMG reports besides the UK phenomenon with Atom Bank Monzo and Starling Bank there are more than 100 challenger banks everywhere. In Germany Fidor Bank Solaris Bank and N26 are the known challenger bank cases. In Spain there are challenger banks backed by incumbent banks like OpenBank from Santander Bank and ImaginBank from CaixaBank. Big tech companies in Asia have launched their challenger banks like China   s MyBank from Alibaba Group and WeBank backed by Tencent. FinTech services 1.2. Competition  issues  affecting  the  provision  of  FinTech  services  depend  on  the  specific characteristics of each service. Therefore the first step in analysing competition issues is to categorise the FinTech services.  The existing literature on this topic proposes several categorisations; however given the rapid evolution of FinTech services there is no consensus on a standard classification                                           16   Caplain J. (2018 p. 1). 17   Some of the best challenger banks and neobanks are arising in the UK attracting big capital investments either  coming  from  venture  capital  like  Goodwater  Capital  or  incumbent  banks  as  BBVA.  According  to Crunchbase since their respective launching date Atom Bank has raised GBP 329 million; Monzo has pulled a total of GBP 109 million; and Starling Bank has obtained USD 70 million.  20 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) yet.

The difficulties in defining the exact scope of FinTech services makes it challenging to quantify  the  size  of  the  current  and  potential  market.  An  additional  difficulty  is  the complexity of differentiating FinTech services provided by traditional firms in the financial sector from other services. As a result there are no estimates of total turnover for FinTech services (considering all the services analysed in this study) as a whole in Europe at the moment.  Market volume 1.3.1. Some research and consulting organisations have provided estimates of specific services in specific countries or regions. Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimated21 the total volume of online alternative finance in the EU to be EUR 7 671 million as of 2016.

Adoption rates 1.3.2. The wide disparity between the available figures highlights the difficulty of aggregating relevant data on FinTech services and reiterates the difficulty of defining the market and delimiting the services to which it refers.                                           25   Dorfleitner G. Hornuf L. Schmitt M. & Weber M. (2016 p. 14). 26   DBK (2017).  26 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) The  consultancy  EY  estimates  that  the  average  FinTech  adoption  rate27  in  2017  was 33 %28. There is consensus that China and India are the countries with the highest share of users with over half of their connected population using FinTech services29.  China and India have large tech savvy but financially underserved populations. In those countries (as in other emerging regions) FinTech services are granting access to financial services  to  millions  of  people  who  would  otherwise  be  excluded.  In  the  case  of  China different factors favour the explosion of FinTech services. Very high rates of internet and mobile  penetration  a  massive  adoption  of  ecommerce  and  a  closed  and  protected domestic  market  and  economy  have  been  the  breeding  ground  for  the  development  of FinTech. The first targets of digital financial services were SMEs and individuals underserved by traditional financial providers followed by a growing middle class with needs regarding wealth and management investments private banking and insurance. Chinese big techs such as Alibaba and Tencent are also taking advantage of great network effects. These technological providers have access to big data from customers mainly from ecommerce and  social  media  services  which  are  used  to  personalise  FinTech  services  and  improve efficiency. Additionally by 2020 it is expected that the Chinese Social Credit System (SCS) a  national  reputation  system  providing  ratings  for  every business  and  citizen  will  be  in place opening new opportunities for FinTech30. In  India  two  important  government  initiatives  have  boosted  the  development  of  digital financial services. One initiative called    Aadhaar    launched in 2009 has allowed 99 % of the Indian adult population to be identified by digital means using biometric technology. The second initiative the demonetisation policy put into place in 2016 pulled out the 500 and  1 000  Indian  Rupees  (INR)  bank  notes  and  gave  a  decisive  stimulus  to  digital transactions. In Europe the UK and Spain are the countries with the highest adoption rates of FinTech  with  41 %  and  37 %  respectively.  Germany  with  35 %  is  the  third  European country above the global average. France and the Netherlands have adoption rates of 27 % Ireland  26 %  and  Belgium  and  Luxemburg  13 %.  These  estimations  include  FinTech services from both new entrants or nontraditional financial firms and traditional financial firms31.  Payments  and  transfers  are  globally  the  FinTech  services  with  the  highest penetration among users (50 %) followed by insurance (24 %) savings and investments (20 %) financial planning (10 %) and borrowing (10 %)32. In general digital disruption seems to have affected corporate banking to a lesser extent compared  to  retail  banking.  The  time  and  effort  required  to  change  a  financial  services provider for a business seems to be one of the reasons33. FinTech providers also tend to solve issues specific to the corporate banking business and therefore present themselves more as potential collaborators or drivers for innovation than as real threats (understood                                           27   Adoption  rate  refers  to  the  average  percentage  of  digitally  active  consumers  using  FinTech  services.

This  is also  the  case  for  insurance where  InsurTech  service providers are mainly focused on the steps of the value chain closer to the user such as sales and distribution but have not yet so clearly threatened the risk carriers    business35.  However the lack of a clear definition of what FinTech services exactly are raises doubts about the real penetration of these services. Estimates made by consultants such as EY or Capgemini use very general concepts related to digital services. The widespread use of digital technologies in all areas of professional and personal spheres has undoubtedly been a key driver for the adoption of FinTech in which users are basically looking for two things easier access to financial services or in some countries even just access and a better user experience. FinTech  is  considered  to  have  an enormous  potential  in  improving  financial inclusion. FinTech  services  have  the  capacity  to  provide  more  accessible  and  affordable  financial services to larger masses of the population and SMEs especially in credits and payments. For  instance  in  many  countries  where  large  rural  populations  have  traditionally  been underserved  by  incumbents  these  populations  can  now  be  covered  by  digitaloriented providers. Poor access to more traditional financial services is in fact one of the reasons explaining the boost of FinTech services in China and India.

The  number  of  branches  and  automated  teller  machines  (ATMs)  indicate  the distribution of bank outlets within a country   s area and its entire population and are a good indicator  of  the  accessibility  of  traditional  financial  services.  Figure  9  shows  the difference in penetration of these services among the countries analysed. These data have several limitations however due to the lack of uniformity in the concentration of these financial  access  points     most  countries  concentrate  their  branches  and  ATMs  in  urban areas    and that the most recent data available dates back to 2015.

Besides  financial  inclusion  it  is  no  surprise  that  improving  user experience  is  at  the heart of FinTech's services conception. Current users increasingly expect to receive better and more efficient financial services as a result of the benefits of digitisation. In fact in 2016  37 %  of  Europeans  expressed  their  willingness  to  switch  their  financial  services provider  if  it  did  not  offer  advanced  technology  services  or  products36.  As  a  result  the traditional loyalty that has characterised financial services providers has been affected by the penetration of FinTech services.                                            36   Fujitsu (2016 p. 15). PE 619.027 31  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  The Special Eurobarometer on financial products and services for the year 2016 showed that in the previous five years only 29 % of Europeans had changed financial providers with car insurance and bank accounts being the products to have most likely changed. The main reasons for not changing are satisfaction with the current provider (46 %) not having considered changing (30 %) the hassle of changing (8 %) and the limited potential benefit of changing (6 %)37. It is not surprising that younger and more techsavvy users are more willing to use FinTech services. According to the consultancy Capgemini38 younger users are 1.4 times more likely to use FinTech services than older users and techsavvy users are twice as likely as nontech savvy users to make use of these services. However unlike what happens with other digitalised services digital skills and access to technology are not the only major factors influencing the penetration of FinTech services. Trust is a key element of all financial services and it is the same in FinTech.  Users still trust traditional firms more than newcomers which are only trusted by one out of four users. Traditional firms are perceived as providing higher security quality of service and  transparency while  nontraditional  companies  are  seen  as  offering  better  value  for money and better efficiency39.  This  reflects  the  underlying  strain  within  FinTech  services  between  improving  the accessibility  and  usability  of  financial  services  through  technology  and  securing consumers     trust  which  is  essential  for  the  functioning  and  stability  of  the  financial system. The European FinTech providers 1.4. We have analysed European FinTech providers and compared them with providers from other relevant regions with the goal of assessing whether the market supply composition and structure may suggest the existence of potential competition concerns. The analysis is made by using the Crunchbase data base40 which provides information about the world   s most innovative companies to analyse the industry structure acquisitions and investments in specific sectors as described in Annex II. The  first  challenge  in  this  analysis  is  to  delineate  the  FinTech  ecosystem  itself.  The Crunchbase database provides a total of 4 359 companies worldwide that are labelled as FinTech companies. After conducting a careful assessment of those companies41 the data showed  that  up  to  507  companies  although  defined  by  themselves  as  FinTech  do  not clearly  engage  in  activities  that  are  related  to  the  use  (or  development)  of  innovative technologies  to  provide  financial  services.  These  results  show  how  complex  it  is  to categorise  companies  as  belonging  to  the  FinTech  market  and  thus  define  a  disruptive sector such as FinTech posing a challenge to policy makers competition regulators and authorities.  Those  companies  were  discarded  resulting  in  a  global  FinTech  sector  of 3 852 companies as shown in Figure 11. The US is the most relevant player in the sector with some 1 500 FinTech companies followed by the EU as a whole with 1 020 companies. Within  the  EU  the  UK  is  by  far  the  largest  contributor  to  the  FinTech  sector  with 454 companies accounting for 45 % of all EU companies.                                             37      Special Eurobarometer 446    (2016). 38   Capgemini (2017 p. 13). 39   Capgemini (2017 p. 15). 40   Crunchbase (2018b). 41   Please see Annex II for the methodology and the applied criteria.  32 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) Figure 11  Number of FinTech companies worldwide by country/region Source Compiled by Iclaves based on Crunchbase (2018b).

Regarding the types of services provided Figure 13 shows the distribution of companies depending on the category of services42 within each of the regions previously identified. Enabler companies are  the  most  frequent  followed  by  providers  of  banking  services.  FinTech  companies providing banking services are more frequent in China and India countries that have a less developed and mature banking system suggesting that in those markets FinTech providers are trying to fill the existing gaps. The profile of the existing financial sector in the country seems to be related to the services provided by newcomer FinTech companies. This fact is also verified when analysing the funding and size of the companies.

The  level  of  investments  in  the  sector  provides  a  good  overview  of  the  relevance  of FinTech services in the different regions.

This  differentiation  aims  at  providing  useful  insights  for  policymakers  in  the  mediumterm  in  view  of  the forthcoming exit of the UK from the European Union and given the big size of the British FinTech market compared to the rest of Member States.  34 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) in 2013 led mainly by the US. The EU including the UK has been particularly active since 2014. It is especially interesting to see how investments in China and India soared from 2015 onwards. In 2016 more than 50 % of overall investments took place in those regions.

PE 619.027 37   Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  The economic potential of the companies that develop in each region can be assessed by analysing  the  average  funding  of  each  company.  Underserved  markets  like  China  and India have a higher average amount of money invested per firm with USD 102 million and USD 77 million respectively compared to USD 40 million in the US and USD 17 million in the EU (excluding the UK) as shown in Figure 19.  Figure 19  Average funding by funded company by region/country (in USD)  Source Compiled by Iclaves based on Crunchbase (2018b).  A higher number of companies in China and India are likely to become relevant players compared to the developed regions (particularly the EU). In the EU those companies are smaller most likely because they are a complement to the existing financial services. In fact in the EU only 4 countries have an average funding per funded company higher than USD 20 million namely Sweden Germany the UK and Belgium as shown in Figure 20. The  small  size  and  low  average  funding  obtained  by  EU  FinTech  companies  are characteristics shared with other digital sectors such as cybersecurity45 or human language technologies46.  Some  factors  (market  fragmentation  reluctance  of  traditional  financing institutions  to  fund  digital  businesses  etc.)  provide  an  adequate  explanation  for  these outcomes while others (e.g. financial crisis) have very limited impact.                                           45   Rivera R. et al.

A  similar  trend  is  perceived  regarding  the  size  of  the  company.  European  companies (including the UK) are smaller with a larger number of microenterprises with less than 10 employees. China and India have the largest percentage of big companies with more than 500  employees  as  shown  in  Figure  21.  Only  companies  providing  currency  services  are larger in the EU compared to the rest of the world.

There are strong differences in how companies are funded depending on the country. In analysing the  percentage  of  money  raised  depending  on  the  funding  stage  FinTech  companies  in India are mainly funded through private equity while in China the money is mainly raised in  early  stage  ventures.  Other  regions  use  a  wider  combination  of  different  funding mechanisms. PostIPO funding    funding raised after a company's initial public offering of stock    is almost negligible in the EU.  40 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) Figure 23  Percentage  of  money  raised  by region/countries funding  stage  within  the  Note A description of the funding stages used can be found in Annex II. Source Compiled by Iclaves based on Crunchbase (2018b).  A  better understanding  of  the  expected  evolution  of  FinTech  suppliers  by  region can  be obtained  by  analysing  whether  new  FinTech  companies  are  acquired  by  third  parties  or whether these companies go public. Market dynamics characterised by acquisitions suggest that incumbents are incorporating new products or services developed by startups into their portfolios while markets more characterised by companies going public suggest that new entrants are consolidating as financial services providers themselves. In the EU and the US the percentage of FinTech companies that have been acquired is much higher than in other markets as shown in Figure 24. In contrast in China and India the percentage of companies that end up listed on the stock exchange is much higher as can be seen in Figure 25. This trend is very relevant from a competition perspective. It suggests that market exit of the startup FinTech companies in the EU mainly happens through acquisitions. It also means that other companies from different sectors enter the FinTech market via acquisitions which leads to the need for a qualified merger control.  Companies in Europe are likely to be acquired by larger firms to complement their current offerings. China however shows a very low percentage of firms acquired and instead has the  largest  percentage  of  Initial  Public  Offering  (IPO)  companies.  This  suggests  that  a significant number of FinTech companies in China are likely to grow and become relevant stakeholders in the financial sector by themselves.

The  first  conclusion  is  that  there  is  a  strong  geographical  endogamy. European companies are acquired by European companies and US companies are mainly acquired by US companies as shown in Figure 26 and Figure 27 respectively. The number of  Asian  companies  being  acquired  is  very  low  as  seen  in  Figure  28.  This  endogamy suggests  that  the  specificities  of  the  markets  (diverse  regulatory  approaches  level  and quality  of  the  services  available  and  consumer  profiles/preferences)  make  it  difficult  for FinTech companies to provide their services outside their local markets. Globalisation in the FinTech  market  is  happening  at  a  rather  low  scale.  Another  insight  is  that  market concentration does not seem to be taking place. Usually the acquiring companies only acquire one FinTech company; there are only a few cases in the US of a company acquiring more than one FinTech company.

FinTech  companies  mainly acquire  enabler  companies  followed  by  payment  and  wealth  management  providers. Technology firms end up acquiring enabler companies and Payment service providers. The results can be seen in Figure 29 (worldwide) and Figure 30 (EU). This finding suggests that the  level of  crossservices  between  the  technology  and financial  sectors  is  still low. Companies in the financial sector acquire mainly FinTech companies providing financial services while technologyrelated companies tend to acquire FinTech companies that offer enabling technologies. The only exception is FinTech companies of Payments Transfer and Forex services for which technology companies seems to be more interested in.

Depending on the maturity of the existing financial sector FinTech services pursue different goals. In underserved markets they are intended to promote financial inclusion while in mature markets they focus on improving user experience by fostering better and more  efficient  innovative  financial  services  by  taking  advantage  of  the  benefits  of digitisation. The suppliers behave accordingly. In underserved markets bigger companies are likely to arise with the goal of becoming relevant new players. By contrast in more mature markets startup FinTech companies are likely to complement the existing offerings in many cases through acquisition processes.  After  analysing  the  markets  and  the  supply  structure  we  have  not  seen  any  clear symptoms  of  competition  problems;  however  FinTech  services  are  still  in  their inception stage and in the medium and long term the situation might change.  What is clear particularly in the more developed regions like the EU is that there is an underlying  tension  between  improving  the  accessibility  and  usability  of  financial services  through  technology  and  assuring  consumer  trust  which  cannot  easily  be achieved by technology. This tension echoes in the balance between maximising efficiency and promoting innovation on the one hand and guaranteeing system stability and consumer protection on the other as shown in Figure 31. This balance is usually sought by means of prudential regulation particularly in banking services such as lending47.                                              47   Bank for International Settlements (2017).  46 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) Figure 31  The underlying tension in FinTech services accessibility vs. trust     Financial inclusion    Improved user experience    Innovation    Security/stability of  system     Trust Source Iclaves (2018).  To summarise the previous analysis FinTech services can be seen as financial activities which provide an added value by means of digital technologies. As shown in section 1.1.1 FinTech  services  can  be  offered  by  different  types  of  companies  so  it  seems  more appropriate to talk about services rather than FinTech companies. What is generally called a FinTech company is actually a company that provides exclusively FinTech services.  The minimum criteria to define a FinTech service are the following       It is a technologydriven financial service      which provides a new solution a new business model or an alternative to what already exists in the financial sector      and offers a significant added value to any of the stakeholders involved in the value chain (mainly the consumer). For the purposes of the following analysis we consider the following classification of different FinTech services48      Banking;      Payments transfers and Forex;      Digital currencies;      Wealth & Asset management;      Personal finance management      Insurance and      Enabling technologies and infrastructures.                                               48   The classification has been already defined in section 1.2. It is described in detail in Annex I. PE 619.027 47  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  2.  COMPETITION ISSUES IN THE FINTECH SECTOR  KEY FINDINGS      FinTech  services  are  constantly evolving  and  the  application of competition instruments  to  analyse  potential  anticompetitive  behaviours  faces  several challenges. Analysis of the dynamics within the new webbased business models is the best way to assess traditional competition concepts such as market definition and market dominance.       Competition  challenges  caused  by  FinTech  can  be  characterised  according  to  a multidimensional  approach  (1)  From  a  supplyside  perspective  there  are  two technologyrelated reasons that can explain competition challenges (I) provision of services through online platforms and (II) the intensive use of data. (2) From  the  demandside  perspective  competition  challenges  depend  on  (III)  the access  and  operation  of  the  technology  by  the  users  and  (IV)  the  user perception and behaviour. result      The combination of platform technologies and the access and operations by users interoperability  and can standardisation. User perception and behaviour help to identify challenges such as  the  definition of  a  relevant market  and  the  role  of  network  effects  as  a source of market power. in  competition  concerns related to      The intensive use of data and technology related to technologies such as algorithms and  AI  may  lead  to  interoperability  concerns  exclusion  of  users  price discrimination practices of tying and bundling and even tacit collusion.      FinTech  services  are  characterised  by  the  confluence  of  startups  large  financial institutions  and  large  tech  companies  as  relevant  competitors.  The  diversity  of origins approaches and potential sources of competitive advantages means that the state of the different markets is in flux. In this context it is difficult to identify advantages  and  sources  of  power  that  are  durable  throughout  time  so competitionrelated patterns should be carefully analysed before considering them as anticompetitive behaviours.  As we have seen in the previous chapter the provision of FinTech services is constantly evolving blurring the boundaries established in the traditional financial sector. In such a scenario which presents commonalities with other markets in the digital economy the application  of  competition  instruments  to  analyse  potential  anticompetitive  behaviours faces several challenges the most relevant being the difficulty in applying traditional competition law instruments to assess competition issues to this rather new and innovative market segment (1) describing the relevant market; (2) defining the market power for a type of service; and (3) analysing anticompetitive behaviours and their root causes.  We  have  already  seen  the  difficulties  of  clearly  defining  FinTech  services  and therefore describing the relevant FinTech markets. For instance the European Commission itself  has  left  the  mobile  payments  market  definition  open  in  several  competition decisions49.  Moreover  the  assessment  of  market  power  cannot  solely  rely  on                                           49   Commission Decisions in the merger cases M.6314 M.6956 and M.6967 for involved companies please see the list of Commission decisions in the list of references at the end of this study.  48 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) traditional indicators such as market share prices or profit margins. These indicators fail to  explain  the  economic  relationships  between  supply  and  demand  in  the  provision  of FinTech services given that some of these services are offered at zero price or are provided through multisided platforms with several stakeholders intertwined50. In response to these challenges a study commissioned by the European Parliament has proposed new ways to better assess the market definition and dominance of services in the digital  economy  as  well  as  potential  anticompetitive  behaviours.  The  study  suggests starting  with  analysing  the  new  webbased  business  models  as     it  allows  to  better account  for  interdependencies  between  multiple  platforms  and  the  interactions  between firm  conduct  and  market  boundaries   51.  The  study  also  proposes  adopting  a  cautious approach  when  assessing  competition  issues  given  the  blurred  boundaries  of  digital markets and relying on sectorial regulation competition instruments and even the selfregulation of digital agents. This combined approach has been followed in order to assess the competition issues in the diverse  categories  of  services  within  the  FinTech  ecosystem  as  they  are  all  part  of  the digital economy. Although each category of services presents different features that can lead to concrete competition issues they also share common characteristics from both the supply and demandside perspective. Therefore prior to the specific description of each category  of  services  the  common  features  and  their  potential  impact  on  competition  is analysed. The  following  discussions  on  potential  competition  concerns  both  those  common  to  all service categories and those identified for specific ones should be deemed as hypothetical analyses given that most of those competition concerns52 have not occurred    or have not been detected by competition authorities    so far. Depending on how the diverse markets within the FinTech ecosystem evolve however these concerns could become a real competition issue in the midterm so stakeholders (competition authorities politicians regulators) should be aware of their implications. 2.1. The supply & demand FinTech explanatory matrix The rationale of the explanatory matrix 2.1.1. The market description in Chapter 1 illustrates the extremely broad landscape of users operators services and strategies as well as the sector   s state of flux. Missing a stable market any analysis of competition is bound to be tentative since competition challenges could unfold in different directions depending on what turns out to be the decisive factor that provides a competitive advantage be it on the technology side or in the users    side. This makes a systematisation effort necessary for at least two important reasons First having  an  overall  classification  of  competition  challenges  is  necessary  in  order  to place each of them in its proper context. Thus if one of them becomes a cause of concern it would be easier to understand its reasons the instruments that could be employed for correcting it and the side effect(s) that the use of those instruments could have in other competition challenges.  Second  this  study  uses  easily  recognisable  categories  of  market  activity  i.e.  the different categories of FinTech services provided and competition problems to organise                                           50   European Parliament (2015). 51   European Parliament (2015 p. 70). 52   However as shown above in the area of payment services there have already been a couple of decisions by the European Commission in merger cases. For further analysis see section 2.3.2. below. PE 619.027 49  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  the analysis. This enhances clarity and offers a more robust structure in a field characterised by its fluidity. Bearing  in  mind  the  advantages  of  respecting  a  more  commonly  accepted  structure  in terms  of  the  categories  of  activities  and  competition  problems  the  study  identifies common patterns that emerge across different categories of activity. Some factors cut across services and make it more challenging to classify them by activity or competition problem. In other words using a servicebyservice approach makes the explanation more accessible and highlights the problems that may be particularly acute in a specific field e.g.  payments.  This  should  not  however  hide  the  fact  that  there  are  strong commonalities in FinTech competition challenges that go beyond a particular service or operator.  Considering this a classification that tries to offer a general and comprehensive view of FinTech   s  broader  competition  concerns  needs  to  take  two  steps.  First  it  needs  to  use categories that go beyond specific services. Second it needs to illustrate FinTech   s unique features  to  the  extent  that  they  are  not  fully  captured  by  financial  services     classical categories. This will make it possible not only to understand the competition challenges that are present in the services as they stand today but to also anticipate the challenges that may arise in the future. To  accomplish  the  goals  of  explaining  FinTech  competition  challenges  the  following explanatory  matrix  is  proposed.  The  matrix  classifies  FinTech   s  competition  challenges pursuant to two perspectives the industry side or supplyside which is based on the type of technology that characterises the services and the demandside which primarily focuses on the perspective of the user when approaching the technology and the service rendered by it. The matrix also shows the categories of problems that fall outside the scope of competition policy (the grey boxes outside the table) and need to be addressed by other policy tools but are still related to competition.

Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) The explanatory matrix   s basic categories supplyside (technology); demandside (users)  The  idea  of  the  matrix  is  to  focus  on  elements  that  help  explain  FinTech   s  existing  or potential competition challenges regardless of the specific type of service or activity. These elements are related to the features of the technology used to provide the service (supplyside) and the users    interaction with the technology and the service (demandside). The specific  features  of  both  perspectives     supplyside  (technology)  and  demandside (users)    and their implications in competition issues will be addressed in more detail in Chapter 3. From a supplyside perspective there are two technologyrelated categories that help explain  competition  challenges  in  FinTech.  The  first  is  platform  technologies.  This encompasses the services that are provided through online platforms i.e. technologies that put parties in contact with other parties with matching needs or requirements. Platforms create unique dynamics in the way the service is defined by involving three sides the two parties that are matched and the platform operator. These dynamics also affect the way market power is achieved and maintained. The second supplyside category is data. The intensive use of datadriven technologies for rendering financial services tends to raise a common group of competition challenges. This stems from the fact that data is a source of competitive advantage and one that is difficult to match measure replicate or substitute. This helps to understand the importance of issues such as access to data or the impact of algorithms in classifying users. From a demandside perspective it is important to differentiate two categories. The first one refers to the access and operation of the technology. This perspective focuses on the technology   s  accessibility  and  compatibility  with  other  technologies  its  features  and standardisation as well as its functioning e.g. how it sorts out users and devises specific prices and conditions of sale. The second demandside category user perception and behaviour focuses on how the users view the technology as a means to deliver a service how they perceive the service itself and the patterns of service usage.  These two dimensions (supplyside and demandside) provide a more general and stable classification of FinTech competition challenges which is not dependent on categories of traditional financial services or traditional competition problems. This classification helps to identify the source of competition challenges and also helps distinguish those challenges that fall completely or partially outside the realm of competition policy.  2.1.3. A  preliminary  list  of  common  competition  challenges  based  on  the  matrix    explanatory categories Starting at the upperleft corner of the matrix by looking at platform technologies (supplyside) from the perspective of access and operations (demandside) one can identify the issue of interoperability as a challenge to competition. This problem arises when the lack of interoperability between two technologies is used by incumbents as an (artificial) barrier of entry for newcomers. The same combination helps to explain the opposite problem i.e. when the standardisation required to facilitate interoperability becomes a source of noncompetitive behaviour because firms lack the incentive to innovate and differentiate.  Moving to the upperright corner of the matrix looking at platform technologies using the perspective of user perception and behaviour helps in identifying challenges such as the definition of the relevant market as well as the role of network effects as a source of market power. The problem of the relevant market i.e. whether certain services must be considered as substitutes is partly determined by the presence of platform technologies but differs from case to case depending on how users perceive and use the platform. This PE 619.027 51  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  in turn results in a certain pattern of use and intensity of use which helps to understand whether network effects in the specific case are strong. It also can give rise to durable market power and unassailable competitive positions. If we focus on the use of dataintensive technologies (supplyside) and consider them from the perspective of the access to the technology and its operation (demandside)    bottomleft  corner  of  the  matrix     the  same  problems  of  interoperability  can  arise this  time combined with the issue of portability of data. The impact of datadriven technologies in being able to sort out users is also a relevant concern. Although the use of datadriven technology helps to gain predictive accuracy the risk is in its use to carry out an unfair exclusion of users or price discrimination. Moving to the bottomright part of the matrix the clearest challenge is the role of access and processing data as a source of market power which can give rise to an unassailable competitive position. This is relevant to detect unlawful collusion abuse or concentrations in datadriven industries. This general concern is important in assessing other challenges such as the relevance of crossusage of datasets as the way in which a large operator with competitive advantage in one activity e.g. a big tech company can use its privileged access to data obtained in that activity to leverage its position in the provision of other services such as FinTech services. The same reasoning applies in the case of practices such as  tying  and  bundling.  In  industries  where  there  are  established  players  with  market power another challenge lies in the risk of exclusionary conduct towards competitors by  refusing  access  to  customer  data  for  example  by  exploiting  users     need  of  consent. When access is open however another challenge lies in the role of algorithms especially AI technology in promoting tacit collusion53. The  matrix  allows  for  a  second  type  of  distinction  between  the  challenges  that  can  be addressed with competition law instruments and those that are excluded from its scope (in  the  grey  boxes  outside  the  matrix).  For  example  access  to  technology  can  be conditioned  by  barriers  of  entry  arising  not  from  an  action  by  incumbents  but  from regulatory requirements e.g. licensing and prudential rules if they are too stringent or not harmonised. Conduct consisting in exclusion or unfair treatment of users may be an issue for consumer protection.  Likewise from a perspective of user perception and behaviour the users    awareness of the service  they  are  subscribing  to  and  thus  the  determination  of  the  relevant  market  of interchangeable services can depend on the transparency with which those services are marketed. This in turn may be determined by disclosure requirements which form part of investor protection rules in securities markets. Finally how certain technologies are allowed to use the users    data do not depend on competition rules but on data protection rules.  In all those cases aspects with a critical impact on the sector   s competitive structure and competition issues fall outside the control of competition authorities. While they fall outside the matrix we visualise them as related factors in order to stress the need for a holistic approach where competition policy and its tools are not seen or used in isolation. Assessing competition challenges in this environment is a daunting task not only because competition policy tools sit at the crossroads of a complex policy environment but also due  to  the  current  state  of  the  market  in  FinTech  services.  Unlike  other  fields  where markets are wellestablished and the relevant players and their features are wellknown FinTech  services  are  characterised  by  the  confluence  of  startups  large  financial                                           53   See section 2.5.2.  52 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) institutions  and  large  tech  companies  as  relevant  competitors54.  The  diversity  of origins approaches and potential sources of competitive advantages means that the state of the different markets is in flux. This means that firms may swiftly change their portfolio of services depending on the activities that they consider similar and susceptible to offering synergies which again may depend on the type of company. At the same time users are relatively new and slowly getting used to the different offers for these types of services. This means that their perception of which offers are comparable and which services are substitutes is in constant change. In this context it is difficult to identify advantages and sources of market power that are durable throughout time or even to talk about incumbents. In the case of strategies being in constant change and market power being contestable and contested the default option should be caution. The following sections describe the business models set out for each service category and the concrete competition issues that might arise between the stakeholders involved. 2.2. Banking 2.2.1. Business  models  replication  of  offline  models  in  deposits     services  and innovation in lending services The  business  models  for  the  provision  of  FinTech  services  related  to  deposits  tend  to replicate those used offline while adding some improved features. FinTech banks usually operate as an aggregator of financial services which can be provided by itself or thirdparties  through  APIs  trying  to  improve  customer  experience  by  increasing  interaction transparency usability and even fun. They seek to empower customers by giving more information and involving them in the decisionmaking processes related to their financial choices. In order to adopt a customercentric approach access to customer data becomes essential. The main business model relies on the maturity transformation a traditional key  function  of  banks  wherein  they  borrow  shortterm  and  lend  longterm  earning  the difference between long and shortterm rates55. The  most  innovative  business  models  within  the  banking  category  are  related  to lending services.  Almost  all  of  them  exploit  two key  concepts  of the  digital  economy multisided platforms and crowdsourcing. They are known as    P2P Lending    or    Marketplace Lending   .                                           54   See section 1.1.1. 55   Drechsler I. Savov A. & Schnabl P. (2017). PE 619.027 53  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  Figure 33  Marketplace lending model scheme Lending PlatformBorrowers(individuals  companies)provision of fundsrepaymentLenders(individualsInstitutions)Client account Source Bank for International Settlements (2017).   The  process  starts  when  a  borrower  either  individuals  or  companies  (mostly  SMEs) applies for a loan on the platform. The platform assesses the credit risk of the borrower based on the credit information provided and approves or denies the application. If the application is approved it is published in the platform and lenders (individual investors or institutional funds) can choose to fund the loan. When the loan is completely funded the funds are transferred to the borrowers and they begin to repay the loan. The platform revenues  come  from  interest  incomes  and  fees  charged  to  the  transaction  parties56. Several variations of this basic model coexist in the market regarding the methods used to calculate the interest rate (the borrowers fix the maximum interest rate they are willing to pay out the platform sets out an interest rate based on the credit information borrower  and  lender/s  negotiate  the  interest  rate  etc.)  determine  how  the  loans  are generated or help lenders select the loans they want to fund among others. The platforms often  provide  advice to  the  lenders  with  the  aim  of  reducing  risks  by  diversifying  their investments over several loans. Another widespread lending model that tries to respond to the regulatory constraints that the previous one faces in several countries is the socalled    notary model   57. In this model the platform only intermediates between borrowers and lenders while a bank generates the loans that the platform allocates.  The  lending  platforms  can  also  generate the  loans  and keep  them  in  their  own  balance sheet (   Balance sheet FinTech lending model   ). Unlike the former models the platform retains  credit  risk  and  often  requires  credit  facilities  or  securitisations  in  order  to  fund originations58.  There  are  also  hybrid  models  (   Composite  Lending   )  that  combine  the                                           56   Bank for International Settlements (2017). 57   Bank for International Settlements (2017 p. 13). 58   US Department of the Treasury (2016 p. 6).  54 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) scalability and efficiency of the marketplace lending model and the stability and viability of the balance sheet lending model. The equity crowdfunding model provides funding to businesses mostly in earlystage companies  in  exchange  for  shares  in  the  company.  The  equity  crowdfunding  platforms assess  the  risks  of  borrowers  and  help  them  look  for  potential  investors.  The  platform charges fees to the borrowers for using its services and to the investor for providing detailed information on the companies who seek funding. Similar to the marketplace lending there are some variations of this basic model. For instance some equity crowdfunding platforms allow investors to put down their money and have it invested according to the criteria of the deal team on that platform. The investors have neither the option to select nor the option to opt out of concrete projects. In other platforms the deal team selects several projects that are pooled in the platform and the investors can choose what project they want to fund. 2.2.2. Competition issues in the business processes regulatory disparities and market power of big tech companies Marketplace lending faces several challenges that could hinder the creation of a competitive market  where  users  both  lenders  and  borrowers  could  benefit  from  the  innovative business models described in section 2.2.1 in terms of efficiency (reduced timing lower fees etc.) from the lender side and financial inclusion from the borrower side. The most relevant one is the diverse regulatory approaches that lending platforms must comply with to operate in different jurisdictions. As the Bank for International Settlements states    There are no internationally agreed financial regulatory standards or policies for FinTech credit lending   59. Some countries have decided to apply the existing regulatory framework regarding licensing and prudential rules while others have enacted specific regulation for marketplace lending. The disparity of the national regulatory approaches may hamper the creation of transnational marketplace lending platforms60. In a recent study the Bank for International Settlements recognised that    existing FinTech companies are developing mainly within individual jurisdictions   61; however    if some services were provided across borders (by relegated disintermediated or new banks) this could increase the need for coordination  and  cooperation  both  between  jurisdictions  as  well  as  across  sectors   62. Regulatory disparities between national jurisdictions could also affect competition in the FinTech lending market as they may become a barrier of entry for new players. These new  players  would  need  to  divert  investments  from  innovation  in  order  to  adapt  their solutions to the concrete requirements of each national jurisdiction. This regulatory barrier to competition has been addressed by the European Commission in its recent FinTech action plan63. Regulation  on  marketplace  lending  platforms  aims  at  controlling  financial  risks  and protecting  consumers  (both  lenders  and  borrowers)  from  inappropriate  behaviours. Regulatory burdens however can somehow blur the main benefits of this model which are (1) efficiency which allows access to funding with lower costs provided in a timelier manner  than  traditional  financial  instruments  and  (2)  the  digital  inclusion  of  those collectives that face difficulties when it comes to accessing credit (lowincome individuals SMEs etc.). Therefore it is necessary to find the right balance between regulation and                                           59   Bank for International Settlements (2017 p. 35). 60   A symptom is the strong geographical endogamy when acquiring FinTech companies described in section 1.4. 61   Bank for International Settlements (2018 p. 34). 62   Bank for International Settlements (2018 p. 34). 63   European Commission (2018b). PE 619.027 55  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  innovation to help foster the development of marketplace lending services while protecting consumers    rights and financial stability. The lending services provided by digital platforms can no longer be considered pure P2P services given the growing presence of institutional investors. They may leverage their market power in the offline lending services market to create their own digital platform to sell loans avoiding investing in other platforms and thus limiting the competition. From the technology side the same approach might be used by the big digital companies. They might also leverage their market power in financialrelated sectors such as ecommerce to enter the marketplace lending services taking advantage of the customers    data they already have. They may for instance develop more accurate credit scoring tools and thus offer  loans  with  lower  interest  rates  and  lower  fees  leading  to  strategies  of  predatory pricing64. They might also offer rebates to buy products if the user takes out a loan from their  own  digital  platform.  Although  it  is  important  to  be  cautious  in  defining  those behaviours as anticompetitive they are two examples of potential competition issues that could occur in the field of marketplace lending services. None of them has been noticed so far in Europe. 2.3. Payments transfers and Forex Business models FinTech providers are entering the whole payment chain 2.3.1. Payment services show certain particularities that make them more attractive for FinTech providers65      Financial incumbents tend to outsource payments and technologyrelated services      Payment  habits  have  evolved  a  lot  in  recent  years  and  new  payment  needs  are emerging      Recent  technological  advances  are  especially  suitable  for  payment  services  (e.g. DLTs) FinTechrelated technology allows for the achievement of economies of scale to provide more efficient payments services in terms of price speed and security. It makes it easier to  meet  the  customers     needs  and  improve  customer  experience  when  using  payment services. These services provide customers with different payment methods favouring the  financial  inclusion  of  people  with  limited  access  to  traditional  payment  services. FinTech providers are leveraging these drivers to position themselves as relevant actors in several stages of the payment chain. According to the Bank for International Settlements the  payment  chain  can  be  structured  in  five  stages  (1)  pretransaction  (2) authorisation  (3)  clearing  (4)  settlement  and  (5)  posttransaction66.  The  pretransaction  stage  involves  the  activities  required  to  create  the  initial  infrastructure  to provide payment services. The authorisation stage refers to the    processes and activities that  enable  a  payment  transaction  to  be  authorised  and  approved  before  it  can  be completed   67. The clearing stage includes processes to reconcile payment orders between the  final  payer  and  the  beneficiary.  The  settlement  stage  refers  to  the  effective  money exchange between transaction parties posting credits and debits in their accounts. Finally                                           64   See for instance the Amazon   s Lending Business strategy https//marketrealist.com/2017/07/acloselookatamazonslendingbusiness. The low interest rates Amazon can offer to its merchants and shoppers thanks to the knowledge that Amazon has about them might prevent other lending platforms can compete in the SME lending market. 65   Bank for International Settlements (2014 p. 1). 66   Bank for International Settlements (2014 p. 5). 67   Bank for International Settlements (2014 p. 40).  56 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) the  posttransaction  stage  includes  the  processes  related  to  statement  generation reconciliation disputing resolution reporting and expost compliance. The following picture details the services included in each stage.

The  business  models  implemented  within  the  payments  landscape  depend  on  the  stage they are focused on the type of customer they are aimed at and the type of collaboration that  exists  with  the  banks.  Taking  into  consideration  these  three  criteria  the  Bank  for International Settlements classifies the payments service providers into four categories68 which can be assimilated into the main business models. Frontend providers They usually focus their activity on the (1) pretransaction (2) authorisation and (5) posttransaction  stages  acting  as  an  intermediary  between  users  of  payment  systems  both payer and payees and traditional providers of clearing and settlement services. They can establish a direct access to the clearing and settlement networks or they can gain access through an intermediary bank. Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISP) defined by the directive PSD2 fall into this category.  Figure 35 Frontend payment services providers BankIndirect Access 5. Posttransaction1.

Competition issues in the business processes the difficulty of defining payments markets and the access to critical assets Payments services compose the FinTech category that competition authorities are paying most attention to. In recent years some competition cases69 have been analysed by the European  competition  authorities.  The  cases  have  referred  to  mergers  acquisitions  and mostly joint ventures between incumbents and/or technology companies to provide new payment tools (ewallets mobile  payments)70. Competition authorities have cleared all the cases so far recognising there are sufficient alternative issuers of payment services in the national markets where the new services intend to operate. The  analysis  of  the  European  Commission   s  decisions  on  competition  cases  related  to payment services mostly on mobile payments systems and digital wallets highlights the difficulty of applying traditional competition tools. The first step to begin analysing anticompetitive behaviours the product market definition is a highly complex task due to a  continuously  evolving  landscape  where  boundaries  between  services  are  blurring.  A recent decision71 summarised this issue    In the UK MCommerce decision the [European] Commission considered that online and offline mobile payments were not likely to be part of the same relevant product market. While the Commission concluded that the situation                                           69   See Commission Decisions on References. 70   In the analysis of the FinTech providers of section 1.4. we have found that the FinTech companies providing financial services that have been acquired by technology companies are mainly those related to payments. 71   Commission Decision in case M.8251 Bite/Tele2/Telia Lietuva/JV. PE 619.027 59  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  could evolve in the short to medium term it ultimately left the product market definition open. With regard to the substitutability of remote/online mobile payments and other types of remote/online payments the Commission concluded that they may belong to different product markets but ultimately also left the product market definition open in that respect. The  Commission  reached  a  similar  conclusion  in  relation  to  the  mobile  proximity/offline payments and existing proximity/offline payment solutions   . If merely defining the product market within the field of payment services is a challenge the subsequent assessment of the market share in order to identify dominant positions is even more difficult.  Another relevant issue for competition in the provision of payment services is the access to  critical  assets  such  as  data  and  mobile  NFC  chips.  Access  to  customers     data  is essential  when  payment  service  providers  process  transactions  between  payers  and payees as all the stages involved in the provision of the service require information from both sides. Blocking or hampering access to customers    data can prevent the provision of  these  services  by  new  entrants  thus  limiting  competition.  This  issue  has  been addressed by the EU through the PSD2 Directive72 obliging incumbents to open access to customers    data and to allow thirdparties to initiate and manage payments on behalf of such customers. Although there has been controversy between the involved stakeholders    incumbents and FinTech startups    regarding the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) as defined by the European Banking Authority (EBA) on strong customer authentication (see Box 1) the PSD2 Directive represents a relevant step in enhancing competition in the provision of payment services.  Box 1  The impact on competition of the process of drafting the Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on strong customer authentication under the PDS2  Article 98 of the PSD2 Directive entrusted the EBA with the task of developing the RTS on  strong  customer  authentication  and  common  and  secure  communication according to the requirements laid down in article 97. The EBA published the draft RTS in February 201773.  According to the manifesto signed by 74 European FinTech companies and associations the RTS banned    a secure proven technology such as Direct Access via the bank   s existing    and  well  maintained     customerfacing  online  banking interface  (sometimes derogatively referred to as screen scraping)   74. The draft RTS stated that screen scraping was not going to be allowed on the basis of several provisions related to security75.  The manifesto signers claimed restrictions to competition if the RTS articles referred to  communication  between  thirdparty  payment  providers  (TPPs)  and  banks  were approved    if the RTS articles on the communication interface were to be adopted in their current  form  Europe   s  successful  and  growing  Fintech  industry  would  be  severely hampered.

In  a  letter77  to  the  EBA  on  May  2017  the  DirectorGeneral  for  Financial  Stability Financial Services and Capital Markets Union expressed the Commission   s intention to amend the draft RTS to include contingency measures allowing access to customers    data  through  the  user  interface.  These  measures  would  take  place  in  the  case  of unavailability  or  inadequate  performance  of  the  dedicated  communication  interface provided  by  the  banks  to  thirdparty  payment  providers.  After  this  letter  the  EBA expressed78 its objections to the fallback solution proposed by the Commission and described  several  negative  consequences  (cost  increase  for  banks  increased fragmentation  compromising  the  development  of  standardised  APIs  competitive disadvantages for thirdparty payment providers no improvement to technical reliability incompatibility with PSD2   s security requirements supervisory constraints and unclear consumer understanding  and  consent).  The EBA  proposed  an  alternative  approach  to substitute the fallback solution but the Commission amended the EBA   s draft RTS79 under the scrutiny of the European Parliament and the Council at the time of writing this study finally including contingency measures for a dedicated interface through the userfacing interfaces that the banks use with their customers.  This controversy highlights the relevance of having access to customer   s data in order to enhance competition in the field of payment services as well as presents the misgivings that exist between banks and FinTech startups.   Within the payment services landscape mobile payments are attracting the attention of many stakeholders as the widespread penetration of smartphones makes them one of the best suitable tools to initiate payments. Access to the key features and components of smartphones that enable payments becomes crucial to develop new payment services. This is the case of the NFC chips which allow two devices placed close to each other to exchange data in a simple way. Technological companies such as smartphone manufactures can exert their market power in order to limit access to those components or to impose potential anticompetitive contractual conditions (see Box 2) to other stakeholders in order to access them.  Box 2  The case of Apple Pay in Australia In July 2016 four Australian banks (Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Commonwealth Bank of Australia  National  Australia  Bank  and  Westpac  Banking  Corporation)  sought authorisation  from  the  Australian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  (ACCC)  to engage  in  limited  collective  negotiations  with  Apple  on  conditions  related  to competition best practice standards and efficiency and transparency regarding access to the iPhone NFC chips. They also sought authorisation to enter into a limited form of collective boycott in relation to the Apple Pay service while collective negotiations with the firm were ongoing. They argued Apple had a significant bargaining power in negotiations  related  to  its  payment  service  Apple  Pay  due  to  its  control  of  both  the                                           76   Future of European Fintech (2017 p. 1). 77   European Commission (2017). 78   European Banking Authority (2017b). 79   European Commission (2017 p. 3).

Their major claim was that Apple only allowed its own integrated contactless payment option Apple Pay on Apple devices impeding access to  the  NFC  chip  to  any  other  applications  for  mobile  payments  developed  for  third parties. All banks must use Apple Pay to provide payment services to the Apple devices owners80. In March 2017 the ACCC rejected granting the authorisation to negotiate collectively with Apple as the Commission believed the application did not pursue the best interest of  consumers.  The  ACCC  stated  that  Apple  was  not  a  monopoly  supplier  of  mobile phones  facing  great  competition  from  several  manufacturers  and  Google   s  Android operating system. Although the ACCC recognised that Apple had significant bargaining power in negotiations it was the result of the vertical integration from device hardware to operating system software and mobile applications software81. The ACCC also stated that    there are other features of digital wallets on which the Applicants may compete without the need for NFC access82. The ACCC finally emphasised that opening access to the NFC controller could result in a significant distortion of competition in mobile operating  systems  as  it  could  affect  Apple   s  current  integrated  hardwaresoftware strategy  for  mobile  payments  and  more  generally  OS.  As  a  result  each  bank  must reach  individual  agreements  with  Apple  to  allow  its  customers  to  use  the  Apple  Pay service. 2.4. Digital currencies Business models from mining to exchange services 2.4.1. According to the Bank of England83 (BoE) a digital currency is    a means of payment that only exists electronically. Like traditional money (such as banknotes) they can be used to buy physical goods and services.   .  The BoE distinguishes84 between private digital currencies those not issued by a central bank  and  central  bankissued  digital  currencies;  both  of  them  rely  on  distributed ledger technologies like blockchain85. Examples of private digital currencies are Bitcoin Ethereum  LiteCoin  and  Ripple.  The  main  difference  between  emoney  and  a  digital currency86 is that the former is based on the conventional bilateral settlement with a trusted central party and the latter is based on the underlying peertopeer structure operated without any central party.                                           80   Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2016). 81   Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2017 p. iv). 82   Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2017 p. vii). 83   Bank of England (2018). 84   Bank of England (2018). 85   Blockchain is a database organised in a decentralised manner which provides a continuously growing list of transfer  datasets  or  records  called     blocks   .  The  database  is  chronologically  extended  and  comparable  to  a chain to which continuously new elements are added. As soon as one block is completed a new one will be started. Each block carries the verification of the previous one and typically contains a cryptographic hash. By design  a  blockchain  is  resistant  to  modification  of  data.  It  was  first  developed  for  Bitcoin  as  a  webbased decentralised record for transactions. Because of using blocks blockchain is slightly different but a specific form of distributed ledger technology (DLT) DLT is also a database which is organised in a decentralised way to record and verify transactions however without writing data in blocks. All records are made at different databases.  There  is  no  central  database  and  no  central  administration.  For  the  purpose  of  this  discussion blockchain and DLT are essentially interchangeable terms. 86   Bank for International Settlements (2015 p. 4).  62 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) Another  term  for  digital  currency  is  cryptocurrency  which  refers  to  the  fact  that cryptographic  techniques  are  used  to  preserve  the  essential  features  of  any  currency namely ensuring authenticity87 and preventing double spending88.  The value chain of the cryptocurrency ecosystem could be described as follows  Figure 39 The cryptocurrency ecosystem and value chain CREDIT CARD PROCESSORBANKECOMMERCE RETAILERTRANSFERP2P PAYMENTSMERCHANTGENERAL PURPOSEOTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIESEXCHANGEWALLETPAYMENTORDERBOOKBROKERAGETRADINGBLOCKCHAIN (DLT)SMART CONTRACTREGULATORS    Financial market    Central Bank   ...MININGMININGMINING POOLHOSTING / HOUSING / CLOUDSILICONHARDWARE Source Compiled by Iclaves based on Hileman G. & Rauchs M. (2017).  Blockchain The substantive element of digital currencies providing these requirements is the socalled blockchain or DLT used as an embedded decentralised payment mechanism that registers any  payments  between  parties.  The  specific  blockchain  platform  used  by  any cryptocurrency is the central element integrating the different activities of the value chain. The  operating  characteristics  of  the  DLT  platform  condition  the  whole  ecosystem  of  the cryptocurrency;  in  particular  whether  it  is  open89  thus  permissionless  or  private therefore permissioned. More specifically in the case of a cryptocurrency promoted by traditional banks the DLT implementation implies defining the participation of the central banks the traditional banks or the supervisors of the different markets involved (securities market bank supervisor    ).                                              87  Authenticity  refers  to  ensuring  that  the  payer  and  the  payee  are  the  intended  ones  regardless  of  their anonymity because every transaction is identified by digital codes and not by their civil names or ID card. 88  Double spending refers to the problem of ensuring that any cryptocurrency unit transferred from one user to another is not spent again by the old holder. 89   Open or closed permissionless or permissioned as described by Hileman G. & Rauchs M. (2017b). PE 619.027 63  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  Blockchain  is  the  central  element  of  the  cryptocurrency  ecosystem  because  it specifies  who  can  participate  in  the  cryptocurrency  system  operation  and  how. Nevertheless it should be kept in mind that regardless of the specific DLT implementation the essential feature of DLT is that it is a decentralised system based on a peertopeer network of nodes collaborating to maintain the ledger of currency transactions. If the cryptocurrency DLT is open or permissionless everyone can develop any of the activities without requiring any market entry authorisation even leaving the system without any regulation. Most of the known cryptocurrencies follow this type like Bitcoin Ethereum or Litecoin. In contrast closed cryptocurrency systems or permissioned ones require a supervisor authorising the entry operation and eventual departure. The central banks or traditional banks could be planning to use those permissioned cryptocurrency systems in an attempt to complement or substitute the permissionless currencies already in use.  Any blockchain system is identified by five components90 (1) cryptography algorithms used; (2) rules of the P2P network; (3) consensus mechanism; (4) ledger; and (5) validity rules. The basic operations that can be performed91 in any blockchain are read write and commit. Mining The activity of committing (updating or changing) the state of the blockchain is known as mining. It consists of appending a new block with the last transaction held after calculating and discovering its hash code92 which includes the one resulting from the last block that was closed (resulting in    a chain    of blocks and codes). The miners or miner pools compete against each other trying to be the first in discovering the hash code therefore requiring huge  computational  resources  and  energy  consumption.  The  miner  that  ascertains  the current block hash code receives a reward in the form of new cryptocurrency units added to the existing monetary base. Nowadays in the Bitcoin model the reward per block is BTC 12.593.  The  mining  subactivities94  are  silicon  design95;  specialised  mining  hardware design and manufacturing; selfmining; hosting housing or cloud mining services for third parties;  and  mining  pools  (pools  of  miners  collaborating  with  their  computational resources).                                            90   Hileman G. & Rauchs M.

This output number or code univocally represents the input string of characters (e.g. the bank book entry). An example of hash function is the SHA256 utilised by Bitcoin. See Narayanan A. Bonneau J.

In  any  public  cryptocurrency  there  is  no  central  bank  controlling  the monetary  supply;  its  growth  is  selfcontrolled  as  a  block  is  closed  which  occurs  approximately  every  10 minutes in the case of Bitcoin.

The wallet96 is the final user application used to securely manage and use  their  coins  (see  Table  4).  Each  cryptocurrency  has  its  own  wallet  reference implementation (e.g. Bitcoin Core97) to be used by developers. In turn payment services98 are related to the transfer of cryptocurrency units and payments to other holders or ecommerce  parties.  The  final  users  need  exchange  services99  to  buy  and  sell cryptocurrencies  exchanging  it  from  and  to  their  national  currencies  (i.e.  EUR/Bitcoin exchanges) or from and to other cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin/Ethereum exchanges).  Smart contracts feature An important additional element of the cryptocurrency value chain is the smart contract feature which allows the parties to implement any contract payment covenants to be selfexecuted when the event succeeds. For example a monthly payment of a house rental or the guarantee release linked to the rental contract when the flat is let out according to the stipulated conditions. Banks and credit card processors Finally the value chain also includes banks and credit card processors as key players in the  cryptocurrency  value  chain  as  they  play  a  very  active  role  in  developing  closed  or permissioned blockchains like Enterprise Ethereum Alliance100 Hyperledger project101 R3 Consortium with Corda102 UBS bank and its Utility Settlement Coin (USC)103 JP Morgan and  its  Quorum  project104  or  Ripple  collaboration  with  Santander  Bank  and  American Express105. They keep relations with central banks and regulators as a way to provide their own solutions to the cryptocurrency world.   2.4.2. Competition  issues  in  the  business  processes  diverse  markets  with  different competition issues The desk research conducted has found very few literature references dealing with current market restrictions to competition in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This is mainly due to the  fact  that  cryptocurrency  is  a  new  sophisticated  and  fragmented  market. Therefore the following analysis can be considered as an exercise of envisioning potential problems  based  on  the  existing  data  and  trends  and  the  market  structure.  Competition issues  can  be  analysed106  according  to  their  impact  on  concentration  (market  share) contestability (network externalities entry barriers) and composition (bundling of services).  Competition  in  the  cryptocurrency  markets  has  been  characterised107  in  the  context  of competition  between  currencies  and  competition  between  exchanges.  Therefore  two different  markets  can  be  identified  the  intercryptocurrency  market  where  different cryptocurrencies  compete  against  each  other  with  diverse  strategic  behaviours  and  the                                           96   Hileman G. & Rauchs M.

PE 619.027 65  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  intracryptocurrency market where different service providers (mining wallet exchange and payment services) compete108. Intercryptocurrency market potential market problems Some  data  can  help  set  the  stage  for  the  analysis  of  intercryptocurrency  market competition issues. According to a recent study109 competition between cryptocurrencies is  still  limited  although  it  is  growing.  While  Bitcoin  accounted  for  86 %  of  the  total cryptocurrency market capitalisation in March 2015 it decreased to 72 % in March 2017. Ethereum accounted for 16 % of the market capitalisation in March 2017 which is the only data we have since this cryptocurrency did not exist in 2015110. Nevertheless these two cryptocurrencies accounted for 88 % of the total cryptocurrency market capitalisation in March 2017 a relevant indicator of the current market concentration. Competition problems of the intercryptocurrency market are quite sophisticated given the complex  activities  that  are  part  of  the  value  chain.  One  of  the  most  significant  is  the presence  of  network  effects111  related  to  the  network  and  platform  nature  of cryptocurrencies. This prevents a currency from being substituted by another competing one and resulting in    a substantial barrier to entry and at the same time give incumbents large market power   112. An increasingly higher number of users of a cryptocurrency and its use as a payment instrument create barriers of entry to new cryptocurrencies due to the lack  of  adhesion  to  its  use  in  merchants  wallets  or  exchanges.  In  the  future  network effects  may  lead  to  potential  collusive agreements  between  members  of  hypothetical cartels.  The question of the implementation of vertical integration strategies either in intracryptocurrency  and  intercryptocurrency  markets  comes  to  mind  when  considering additional  concerns.  Exchange  wallet  and  payment  providers  may  design  behaviour practices to exclude each other from the market e.g. by receiving incentives from miners favouring  a  specific  cryptocurrency  or  from  certain  dominant  players  trying  to  exclude competitors in other activities.  The  arrival  of  permissioned  cryptocurrencies  promoted  by  banks  even  by  central banks  will  reshape  the  current  competition  level  in  the  intercryptocurrency  market broadening the number of competitors113. A potential inadequacy of traditional competition policy  to  address  competition  issues  in  the  cryptocurrency  markets  can  be  found114 suggesting direct public participation through a centralbank digital currency as a remedy.  The international nature of cryptocurrency markets115 is also a challenge to competition policy at the European level. Many of the players operate from global locations outside the jurisdiction of European competition authorities which makes investigation or prosecution on  anticompetitive  behaviours  more  difficult.  Europe  leads  at  international  level116  the supply of wallet and exchange services with 42 % and 37 % in terms of number of players. It  is  also  the  principal  actor  in  payments  (33 %).  Nevertheless  the  main  weakness  of Europe is the concentration of the mining activity on nonEuropean countries (Europe only capture just 13 % of the current mining market). Mining is the most strategic sophisticated                                           108  See Figure 39. 109  Hileman G. & Rauchs M. (2017a). 110  Hileman G. & Rauchs M.

Intracryptocurrency market potential competitive misconducts Market  power  of  incumbent  banks  might  be  used  to  limit  competition  in  the  intracryptocurrency  market  through  preemptive  acquisitions  or  predatory  pricing schemes. Incumbent banks may also engage in anticompetitive practices by denying access to  their  gateways  for  exchange  or  wallet  services  such  as  bank  payment  and  transfer systems or card processor schemes. This denial of access may be conducted by means of low service quality delays in negotiation proprietary technical standards or excessive pricing.  These  practices  may  deter  consumers from  using  the  permissionless cryptocurrencies in favour of the permissioned ones promoted by banks. Another potential anticompetitive factor is the standardisation of DLT and other technical protocols.  Private  or  public  consortia  agreements  in  relation  to  technical  standards  may affect the market entry or impact current costs. In fact 70 % of the large miners rate their influence on protocol development as high or very high117. The mining market The mining market has evolved from    a hobby activity in the early days to a professional industry  where  large  amounts  of  capital  are  at  stake   118.  The  mining  market  cannot  be considered  a  truly  traditional  market  where  prices  would  be  determined  by  supply  and demand  because  price     mining  reward     is  selfscheduled  by  the  cryptocurrency  own algorithm at fixed rewards per fouryear periods. Thus there is not an efficient pricing system  of  mining  activities.  Their  lack  of  cost  orientation  or  market  pricing  creates disincentives to miners either by having excessive pricing or by pricing below real costs.  Mining can currently be considered a noncontestable market because of the presence of high barriers of entry derived from the existing economies of scale in processing power energy  efficiency119  (intracryptocurrency  market)  and  scope  (intercryptocurrency market). Cartels may arise120 in mining pools but the lack of price coordination due to the use of a shortterm fixed mining reward is a negative proof of their existence. The  market  is  currently  dominated  by  a  low  number  of  mining  pools     the  five  leading mining pools accounted for 79 % of the total market share in Q4/2016121    although none of them exert a dominant position (the leading mining pool AntPool accounted for 23 % of the total market share). Thus future horizontal mergers and acquisitions between mining firms should be assessed in terms of market competition and efficiency gains. The wallet exchange and payment market Wallet and payment markets are characterised by a high number of providers122 thus it demonstrates  that  nowadays  there  are  low  barriers  to  entry.  The  exchange  market presents the highest number of providers of all cryptocurrency markets123. The exchange market  however  presents  a  high  degree  of  concentration  with  five  providers accounting for 75 % of the total Bitcoin exchange market share and the leader reaching a                                           117  Hileman G. & Rauchs M.

Nevertheless as explained before the three markets are subject to potential network effects which can deter competition. A general competition problem of excessive pricing as a result of market power can arise in any of these markets if users cannot easily move their currencies from one supplier to another (exchange services when buying or selling a cryptocurrency in wallet maintenance or payment transactions). These competition problems arise in relation to multihoming or singlehoming sceneries125 if switching costs or technical restrictions prevent users from moving from one wallet or exchange app to another. Albeit the wallet exchange and payment markets may be considered separated markets the boundaries between them are increasingly blurring. For instance 52 % of wallets provide an integrated currency exchange feature126. Thus vertical integrated players ranging  from  wallet  to  mining  activities  may  design  anticompetitive  exclusionary practices127 to foreclose the individual markets for instance by crosssubsidising their mining  activities  with  their  rewards.  In  this  sense  vertical  mergers  should  be  paid attention to. 2.5.  Wealth & Asset management Business models online platforms for advisory and management services 2.5.1. The introduction of the concept of platforms is reshaping the way the wealth and asset management  services  are  being  provided.  New  business  models  are  mainly  developed around platforms that connect customers who seek advice and want to know where to invest  their  assets  with  wealth  and  asset  managers  offering  their  financial  products.

Financial aggregator platforms are considered  by  IOSCO  as  instruments  to  inform  customers  about  their  daily  spending savings and investments so they are going to be analysed within the category of PFM. Comparison websites These services allow customers to find financial products. Some of them offer access to a broad  set  of  services  ranging  from  banking  services  (bank  accounts  loans  etc.)  to investment management (pension funds investment funds etc.) although they tend to focus on concrete categories. Comparison websites are conceived as twosided platforms                                           124  Bitcoinity (2018). 125    stbye P. (2017). 126  Hileman G. & Rauchs M.

They are based on algorithms that use  the  information  provided  by  the  investors  to  determine  their  risk  tolerance  and  to propose  an  investment  portfolio  according  to  it.  They  also  manage  and  rebalance  the proposed portfolio to adapt it to the investor   s expectations and objectives.

These  platforms  combine  the  features  of  social networks integrating information sharing and social interaction with online trading. They are also known as    copy trading platforms    or    mirror trading platforms    although several minor  differences  exist  between  them.  The  platforms  usually  offer  a  wide  range  of investment products such as exchangetraded funds (ETFs) stocks commodity currencies derivatives  and  so  on.  The  platforms     revenues  come  from  the  fees  charged  to  the customers.                                             129  Deloitte (2016b p. 2).

They provide services such as sentiment analysis using natural  language  processing  (NLP)  techniques  and  machine  learning  crowdsourced research which seeks ideas from diverse sources such as retail customers and financial services providers or social networking tools to discuss investing ideas among users. The aggregated information is sold to investment firms. Competition issues in the business processes the impact of algorithms 2.5.2. A  recent  study130  conducted  by  the  Financial  Conduct  Authority  (FCA)  on  the  asset management  market  in  the  UK  the  second  largest  in  the  world  highlights  several competition issues which may be extrapolated to the EU. The FCA points out that price competition is not working as adequately as it should be in several areas of the asset management  market  partially  derived  from  a  price  clustering  with  charge  schemes almost  unaltered  over  the  last  10  years  and  high  levels  of  profitability  of  asset management  firms.  Albeit  the  introduction  of  innovative  services  thanks  to  the technological  development  customers  might  not  be  obtaining  better  prices  from  these innovations. This also has to do with a certain lack of transparency on the fees charged to investors an issue that has been addressed by MiFID II131 through its cost disclosure requirements for investment firms. The diverse nature of the services with blurred lines between information advisory and management  functionalities  poses  challenges  to  regulatory  bodies  and  financial supervisors on the licensing regime to apply to each provider. Furthermore each national jurisdiction may require different conditions to grant licenses hindering the provision of crossborder  services  and  thus  limiting  the  competition  on  national  markets  to national providers.  The  blurred  boundaries  between  services  and  the  growing  relevance  of  the  investment management platforms in the market might also lead to certain conflicts of interest. The automated advisory services provided to investors via algorithms might not be based on their  risk  profile  and  other  objective  variables  but  oriented  by  the  platform  operator towards  concrete  investment  solutions  or  intermediaries  that  offer  higher  commission fees132.  Algorithms are at the heart of the provision of investment advice and management and they have become the key feature of many FinTech services in recent years. In a general approach not only restricted to FinTech services algorithms pose several procompetitive effects133      On the supplyside they contribute to increase transparency and to the development of more efficient services and products (lower production costs enhanced quality and more efficient resources management).      On the demandside algorithms provide better structured information to customers helping them make their decisions. They help customers learn how to act not only based                                           130  Financial Conduct Authority (2017). 131  European Parliament (2014). Articles 24 25 and 27 of MiFID. 132  IOSCO (2017 p. 31). 133  OECD (2017 p. 12).  70 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) on  competitionrelated  facets  such  as  price  but  also  based  on  quality  and  other consumers    experiences. Notwithstanding their benefits algorithms also pose several risks to the competition process.  According  to  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development (OECD)    a particular concern highlighted in the literature is the risk that algorithms may work as a facilitating factor for collusion and may enable new forms of coordination that were not observed or even possible before. This is referred to as    algorithmic collusion      134.  The  OECD  defines  four  roles  algorithms  can  play  in  digital  markets  as  facilitators  of collusion135      Monitoring  algorithms  they  collect  and  process  information  from  competitors    behaviours and can be used to enforce previous collusive agreements.      Parallel  algorithms  they  react  to  any  change  in  market  conditions  replicating  a concrete  pattern.  They  can  be  shared  by  firms  and  be  programmed  not  to  compete among them but to set a coordinated pricing strategy.      Signalling algorithms  they  offer  signals  (for  instance a  temporary  price  increase) and process the signals emitted by competitors to set the prices after all of them agree on those prices by sending the same signal.      Selflearning  algorithms  these  algorithms  based  on  machine  learning  and  deep learning technologies can produce collusive outcomes by themselves without human intervention as they can learn and conclude that the best way to maximise profits is to develop collusive practices.  Regarding  wealth  and  asset  management  services  all  these  algorithms  could  be implemented. While competition issues derived from the first three might be adequately addressed through traditional competition enforcement tools it remains unclear if these tools are enough to cope with competition problems issued by selflearning algorithms as human intervention seems to somehow fade because the initial programme is modified by selflearning.  2.6. Personal finance management 2.6.1. Business  models  analytical  and  visualisation  tools  to  help  customers  to understand their financial situation Personal finance management services are services that facilitate the way in which people manage  their  money.  These services  are  dominated  by mobile apps  and  are  aimed  to improve  the  financial  wellness  of  users  by  providing  useful  information  on  their personal financial situations. By accessing the banking and financial information of the user these apps improve the user   s understanding of his/her own situation allowing him/her to create and manage budgets debts and savings. In practice they do not provide financial services but instead offer analytical and visualisation tools provide useful information and address queries through programs such as chatbots (software that allows users to interact with their providers through natural language    both written and spoken    without human intervention from the providerside). Although some apps include features from other FinTech services such as tools for paying bills in general transactions are done by users in direct contact with their financial services provider. Services from the financial manager only include information and data gathering                                           134  OECD (2017 p. 16). 135  OECD (2017 pp. 24   32). PE 619.027 71  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  as well as analysis alerts and recommendations. Therefore PFM services do not replace incumbents  or  other  nontraditional  FinTech  service  providers  but  instead  complement their services by improving management and facilitating the visualisation of information serving as an interface between financial services and products.  Figure 41  Personal finance business model FinTechproviderInformationRecommendationsAlertsTransactionsUser Access to dataBank  credit cards & other providersSource Iclaves (2018).  Revenue  and  monetisation  models  for  this  type  of  services  are  essentially  the  same  as those for mobile applications      Free models users do not pay to download or use the services. Monetisation comes from the display of ads within the site or app or recommendations of products based on the user   s data and activity. Normally revenues depend on the clicks made by users in ads or recommended services or products.      Freemium model users do not pay to download the app and have limited access to the  functionalities  of  the  services.  Users  must  pay  to  access  advanced  premium  or certain services within the app or to use the services more than a certain number of times.       Pay models users pay to download the app or they pay an amount regularly to use the service normally in monthly or annual fees.  2.6.2. Competition  issues  in  the  business  processes  customer   s  data  access  and security Competition issues regarding digital PFM services arise mainly in the field of customers    data  access.  Historically  many  traditional  financial  services  providers  such  as  banks imposed restrictions on FinTech providers trying to access customers    account information. Security reasons were usually used to limit this access creating technical entry barriers for some service providers. Such limitations have been addressed by the PSD2 Directive which defines the    Account Information Services Provider    (AISP)136 as a type of payment service  provider  and  obliges  the     Account  Servicing  Payment  Service  Provider     (ASPSP) usually  banking  institutions  to  open  the  access  to  customer  accounts     data  to  AISPs.                                           136  Article 33 Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payments services in the internal market  http//eurlex.europa.eu/legalcontent/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX32015L2366&from=EN.             72 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) Although  there  has  been  some  controversy  between  AISPs  and  ASPSPs  on  the  ways  to access data137 in this case the potential competition issues have been addressed using a specific regulation.  Box 3  The Open Banking initiative in the UK In September 2015 HM Treasury created the Open Banking Working Group which included  representatives  and  experts  from  the  banking  sector  FinTech  companies consumer  organisations  and  the  government  in  order  to  define  a  framework  for  the development of an open standard for APIs to make nonpersonal data owned by banks publicly available. In 2016 the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) proposed the Open Banking approach as a remedy to incentivise competition in the UK banking sector. The CMA has set  up  the  Open  Banking  Implementation  Entity  (OBIE)  a  company  in  charge  of  the effective implementation of Open Banking in the UK. The OBIE is governed by the CMA and funded by the UK   s nine largest banks. The OBIE has the following objectives138    Design the specifications for the APIs          Support regulated third party providers and banks to use Open Banking standards      Create security and messaging standards      Manage the Open Banking Directory      Produce guidelines for participants in the Open Banking ecosystem      Set out the process for managing disputes and complaints    Under  this  initiative  the  UK  competition  authority  has  compelled  incumbent  banks  to adopt  the  Open  Banking  standards  fostering  competition  in  banking  services  and allowing customers to better manage their money.  Security and data privacy are key elements of these services since by using these services users allow third parties to access their account information regarding deposits credit cards or debts. They do not however represent potential threats for competition. Other issues although not linked to competition that might affect consumers    protection are transparency and neutrality of the recommendations made by these sites and apps.  2.7. Insurance Business models disintermediating customers and risk carriers 2.7.1. Digital transformation is disrupting the insurance sector by introducing innovations in all the links of its value chain.  Although  most  of  the  innovations  so  far  have  affected  the     front  part  of  the  insurance ecosystem     that  is  the  parts  related  to  communication  with  the  clients  new  business                                           137  See Box 1. 138  Open Banking Implementation Entity (2018). PE 619.027 73  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  models are arising that might threaten the role of traditional insurers and result in a total disintermediation139.  Technological innovations such as data analytics and AI blockchain robotics and IoT are leading to the openingup of new customer segments and even new markets allowing the coverage of new products the creation of new ways of interacting with the customer and new ways of managing the business. Consumer engagement and retention has been one of  the  most  affected  areas  by  InsurTech  hatching.  As  a  result  the  sector  is  also experiencing a shift from reaction to prevention with new tools for assessing risks and setting prices for premiums. This allows for greater personalisation for example by linking policies to personal data through new devices such as wearables.  Figure 42  InsurTech value chain Product developmentMarketingDistribution & SalesPricing & PoliciesClaims & assistanceSource Adapted from McKinsey & Company (2017).  The impact of new technologies can be seen in all steps of the value chain      Product  development  new  technologies  have  fostered  the  emergence  of  new products in the insurance market allowing the coverage of previously underserved consumers and the creation of new products tailored or personalised.

These technologies help  reduce  costs  and  improve  responsiveness  along  with  providing  effective communication with clients.       Digital claims      Fraud detection InsurTech services providers have most often focused on only one step of the value chain142 instead of covering many of them. Partnerships between incumbents and new entrants particularly startups have been frequent. Incoming startups have posed more of a threat to intermediaries in the sector such as brokers than to insurers since risk carrying has mainly remained in the hands of incumbents. Disintermediation however may allow nontraditional InsurTech providers to control the whole process143. 2.7.2. Competition  issues  in  the  business  processes  commonalities  with  FinTech competition concerns  The insurance sector has been one of the few sectors in the EU that has benefited from a block exemption regulation144. The last renewal145 of the Insurance Block Exemption Regulation146 (IBER) came into force in March 2010 and expired in March 2017. It granted exemptions  on  the  application  of  Article  101(1)  of  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the European Union (TFEU)147 to two types of agreements between insurance companies                                            140  EIOPA (2017). 141  For the  definition  see  section  2.6.1.

Common coverage of certain types of risks by a pool of insurance undertakings. In  2016  the  EC  assessed  the  need  of  a  new  renewal  of  the  IBER148.  The  Commission concluded that the exemption was no longer necessary as the Commission   s Horizontal Agreements  Guidelines  provided  a  comprehensive  set  of  competition  principles  to  selfevaluate  the  adequacy  of  information  exchange  agreements.  Albeit  the  decision  not  to renew the IBER was not based on technological reasons the possibilities opened by big data technologies to better predict the risk probability and its potential cost influenced the Commission   s decision.  The  competition  issues  in  the  provision  of  InsurTech  services  have  similarities  to  those experienced  in  the  field  of  FinTech.  Access  to  customers     data  and  the  impact  of algorithms  on  pricing  strategies  are  the  main  factors  that  can  lead  to  anticompetitive practices. The distribution ledger technologies mainly blockchain are also going to have a prominent role in several processes of the InsurTech value chain particularly on record keeping transfer value peertopeer insurance and supporting smart contracts149. Given its relevance the standardisation of private blockchains150 might create entry barriers if the standardisation process lacks the required transparency. Enabling technologies and infrastructures 2.8. The enabling technologies described in section 1.2.7. are not specific to FinTech services. Even if DLT was born within the FinTech world it is increasingly used in other sectors. Each technology/infrastructure identified is positioned in the market with specific characteristics. Business models from consulting services to Software as a Service 2.8.1. Four different technologies and infrastructures can be considered as enablers of FinTech services.  Distributed Ledger Technologies / blockchain These technologies have emerged from financial applications (i.e. accounting payments and transactions) but they are also valuable for other applications such as      Commercialisation  of  assets  that  require  strict  control  legal  trade  of  drugs  for medical  purposes  diamonds  etc.  DLT  can  bring  the  required  guarantees  that transactions are clean registered and all parties are identified.      Evoting DLT are used to ensure transparency. It  is  possible  to  implement  DLT/blockchain  using  available  IT  technologies  and  most  IT consulting  firms  can  offer  the  service.  From  the  business/competition  perspective  this technology  falls  into  the  larger  category  of  specialised  software  implementation  and services.                                             148  European Commission (2016). 149  EIOPA (2017 p. 10). 150  Blockchain networks can be divided into    public blockchains    where anybody can join the network (the main example is Bitcoin) and    private blockchains    with restricted access to known participants. EIOPA (2017).  76 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) AI & Data analytics In the last decade data analytics and AI have been made broadly available. This has eased the  creation  of  many  companies  in  this  area.  Moreover  large  IT  consulting  firms  have created specific areas to bring this service to their customers. According to Crunchbase there are more than 10 500 companies registered within the categories of    Analytics    and    Artificial Intelligence   .  Initially  Data  Analytics  and  AI  companies  provided  crosssectorial  services.  Over  time however companies have focused on concrete sectors or knowledge areas151.  The incorporation of AI into FinTech services may be done in several ways      Professional  services  collaborating  in  the  development  of  the  FinTech product/service.      Integration of modules/components into the FinTech product/service.      Using  AI  as  an  external  service.  In  this  case  they  fall  into  the  category  of    Advanced Services from Cloud Infrastructures   .  Cybersecurity  Cybersecurity is one of the most vibrant digital sectors nowadays and it is foreseen that it will continue growing in the coming years. All activity areas within the FinTech environment are  concerned  with  the  implementation  of  the  appropriate  cybersecurity  measures  to protect their operations. Companies in this area fall into three categories      Specialised firms normally SMEs that focus their activity to provide high added value.      Department of large consulting firms providing security as part of a complete portfolio of IT professional services.      Product vendors that commercialise offtheshelf products; for instance antivirus firewall products etc. There is a sufficient number of companies in the market to ensure fair competition. Advanced Services from Cloud Infrastructures There are many companies providing basic cloud services but the provision of advanced cloud services (data analytics and AI) is limited to the large actors of the cloud market IBM Amazon Google and Microsoft. Only these few companies provide advanced services for huge data analytics AI algorithms available on demand and many other added value services. These big cloud companies leverage economies of scale to provide these advanced services at a reasonable price. There is a strong competition among them and more and more services are included in their respective portfolios.  In  the  last  few  years  there  have  been  new  companies  that  have  provided  specialised services based on A.I. as providers of real time summaries of text152 text classifiers153 or automated  translation154.  In  spite  of  these  examples  and  many  others  that  could  be mentioned the reality is that the position in the market of the four major players mentioned                                           151  CB Insights reported in December 2017 the list of 100 startups in AI arena already segmented into sectorial areas.

PE 619.027 77  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  makes competition very hard for other companies. Any new company willing to compete in the market needs to clearly define its competitive advantage and gather huge investments. This is the only enabling technology/infrastructure that might be considered in doubt with respect to competition issues as its market shows the characteristics of an oligopoly. Business models implemented for each enabling technology The  aforementioned  technologies  and  infrastructures  are  provided  through  different business models. In all cases the FinTech company supports the cost of the service in its cost  structure  by  direct  payment  to  the  technology/infrastructure  provider.  Enabling technologies/infrastructures  are  transparent  to  the  final  user  who  gets  the  service regardless of internal implementation details. The next table shows the main business models and their relationship with the enabling technologies of FinTech services.  Table 2 Business models for the provision of FinTech enabling technologies Business Models DLT AI companies Cybersecurity Advanced Cloud Services Consulting and Professional Services Products OEM Software as a Service  Source Iclaves (2018). X  X  X  X X X X X  X  X X Consulting and Professional Services Most technology and infrastructure providers offer their customers the possibility to hire specialised services. Customers can approach specialised professionals to help them in the creation and evolution of their business. The business model is a direct sale of the services from the consulting firm to the FinTech company. This is an area where competition is open and there are many options for a firm to  hire  these  specialised  services.  The  current  market  is  not  dominated  by  any  specific consulting firm. Products Fullfledged products as such are only available in the cybersecurity market from antivirus software to firewall or attack detection. Again the business model is a direct purchase of the product by the FinTech company. Products  are  normally  sold  on  a  yearly  licence  basis  with  periodic  updating.  No  specific obstacles for competition have been detected so far in this area. OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) The OEM model implies the integration of a product or service (text analysis translation etc.) from an external vendor into the solution provided by the FinTech company. These services  can  be  provided  as  components  that  are  integrated  into  the  FinTech  78 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) product/service  or  as  a  call  to  an  external  IT  service  hosted  outside  the  FinTech  IT infrastructure. In the last case the integration can be considered an implementation of the Software as a Service model. No specific barrier for competition is found in this area. Software as a Service This model is complementary to the previous one. It can be considered a particular case of OEM where the service is incorporated into the FinTech application in order to provide the service to the customer. The  business  model  is  a  direct  payment  from  the  FinTech  company  to  the  service providers which may be in the form of monthly or yearly subscription periods. The FinTech company must then evaluate the impact of incorporating the service into its application and the cost involved in integrating the service in order to consider if a change of provider is required in the future. No company has a dominant position in this market but the de facto oligopoly of the big tech companies already mentioned might create barriers of entry for new players. 2.8.2. Competition issues in the business processes oligopoly in the advanced cloud services market Most of the enabling technologies and infrastructures of FinTech services particularly DLTs AI  and  Data  Analytics  are  still  in  their  infancy  with  many  providers  competing  in fragmented markets. Although they are also subject to several factors that might result in anticompetitive  behaviours     standardisation  processes  network  effects  mergers  and acquisitions    none of them has materialised so far.  In  the  field  of  cybersecurity  the  provision  of  services  in  Europe  also  remains  very fragmented155.  Under  the  umbrella  of     cybersecurity  services     however  there  are some specific  technology  niches  where  market  concentration  and  potential  competition concerns might occur.  Box 4  Payment smart card market concentration in France In April 2017 the European Commission cleared the acquisition of the security solutions provider Morpho based in France by the US equity firm Advent International although subject to conditions156. The acquisition of Morpho would have reduced the number of competitors in the French payment smart card market to two as Oberthur another payment  smart  card  provider  was  also  controlled  by  Advent  International.  The Commission also highlighted in its decision the difficulties to enter this specific market in France  given  the  certification  and  standardisation  requirements  set  out  by  French authorities  (manufacturers  of  payment  smart  cards  must  obtain  and  maintain  a certification for the domestic debit card scheme Cartes Bancaires as well as the global EMV    Europay Mastercard Visa    certification standard). As a result the Commission expressed  its  concerns  on  how  the  operation  could  affect  competition  in  the  French payment  smart  card market. The  Commission finally  cleared  the  acquisition  after the parties    offer of divesting Morpho   s French subsidiary CPS in order to maintain a certain level of competition in that market.                                           155  Rivera R. et al.

PE 619.027 79  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  Another area where competition could be threatened is the provision of advanced cloud services. As mentioned in section 2.8.1 this market is dominated by a few number of big tech  companies  and  furthermore  the  barriers  for  new  actors  to  access  are  huge  (the required investments are very high and the return is not yet clear as the offer is becoming nearly a commodity). The major problem in evaluating potential anticompetitive behaviours is  again  the  market  definition.  Advanced  cloud  services  can  include  many  diverse functionalities  with  blurred  boundaries  which  hinder  the  assessment  of  market  shares pricing policies etc.     80 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) 3.  AN ASSESSMENT OF COMPETITION CHALLENGES AND THE USE OF COMPETITION INSTRUMENTS KEY FINDINGS      Multisided  markets  such  as  FinTech  platforms  imply  that  the  definition  of  the relevant market cannot be undertaken following traditional models built on the premises  of     pipeline     businesses  where  value  is  generated  by  the  supplier  of  a product or a service.       FinTech platforms are not as regulated as financial trading platforms and therefore the challenges arising from network effects need to be assessed as a competition challenge. Network effects enable a large platform to be insulated from competition from smaller platforms with fewer participants and can create barriers of entry. Yet network effects are not indicative per se of the existence of competition problems that need to be addressed.      An active pursuit of noninteroperability in the provision of FinTech services can act as a deterrent with anticompetitive effects if access to the market is difficult or costly or can even cause foreclose effects when barriers are insurmountable.      The  role  of  data  to  establish  a  competitive  advantage  which  can  give  rise  to exclusionary conducts such as refusal of access or exclusive contracts needs to be borne in mind as one of the elements when assessing the position of a company resulting from a merger.      Some of the competition challenges described in this section fall outside the scope of competition tools and they should be addressed by specific regulations of the financial sector (investor protection rules licensing scheme prudential rules) data protection and privacy laws or consumer protection laws.   3.1. The  landscape  of  competition  challenges  and  the  use  of  competition instruments descriptive and normative tools The explanatory matrix as a descriptive tool 3.1.1. In this section the explanatory matrix introduced in Chapter 2 is used again to systematise each competition challenge by focusing on the main technological features defining the service (supplyside) and on the users    perspective (demandside). We consider that the  combination  of  these  two  factors  is  a  better  predictor  of  the  risk  of  competition challenges than the specific features of the service itself. The competition challenges tend to depend more on certain technological features such as the provision of services through online platforms or the access to data and on the intensity of customers    interaction with the service than on whether that service is defined as    banking       payment    or    advice   .

Investor protection (eg. MiFID)Data protection  The benefit of using this matrix is twofold. First it provides a conceptual anchor and a tool to anticipate problems in a field subject to fast changes where it is not possible to anticipate whether technologies or services will evolve first. For example today it is useful to explain separately the services of banking and payments because they are offered and requested distinctly from each other; however they might converge in the future. By using platform  technology  or  big  data  as  key  features  it  is  still  possible  to  anticipate  which competition issue could potentially occur in each case157.  Second  the  classification  helps  to  anticipate  the  areas  of  policy  action  (regulation  and licensing  investor  and  consumer  protection  or  data  protection)  that  may  overlap  with competition  policy.  This  is  a  necessary  first  step  in  differentiating  which  instances  of competition challenges might require the use of competition policy tools because they fall squarely within one of the light blue cells of the matrix from those challenges which result  from  factors  outside  the  reach  of  competition  policy.  That  is  whether  the competition challenge is merely a problem that stems from the lack or inadequacy of tools in other fields or the problem can be addressed using both competition policy tools and other policy tools158. Still this framework of analysis has some limitations. First the matrix does not intend to create mutually exclusive categories. Many FinTech services will be characterised by the use  of  platforms  but  also  by  dataintensive  technology  and  they  will  likely  lead  to competition challenges typically associated with both. In a similar way one service may involve  issues  regarding  both  aspects  of  the  demandside  perspective.  Secondly  the classification  is  not  based  on  closed  compartments.  The  operation  of  a  certain                                           157  Sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.5 discuss the specific competition issues following the structure of the matrix. 158  In Section 3.1.4 we discuss these in more detail and in section 3.1.5 we offer a decisiontree as the analytical tool to calibrate the appropriateness of using competition tools and other tools in addressing each competitive challenge.  82 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) technology may often be difficult to disentangle from aspects related to the users    behaviour and  their  awareness  of  the  process.  For  instance  the  degree  and  necessity  of standardisation  may  be  linked  to  the  users     stable  and  predictable  preferences  and expectations about how a process should work. Consistent exclusionary or discriminatory patterns in an algorithm   s operation may relate to certain factors in the users    behaviour with strong predictive power. Even in those cases the matrix helps to distinguish between different angles of a single problem as a first step in identifying the best tools to deal with each of those angles. Third  this  is  an  explanatory  matrix  that  helps  to  classify  the  issues  but  has  no independent normative force. That is the matrix can help to classify the causes and elements of a specific problem but by itself can neither diagnose whether the problem involves a specific pathology that needs to be addressed nor point to a specific tool or combination of tools to address the problem. The tools used will depend on whether the problem is real or potential the intensity with which it materialises its accompanying facts in  each  specific  context  the  authorities     goals  and  priorities  and  the  suitability  and limitations of the different tools to address the issue. These aspects need a more indepth discussion not limit to bidimensional classifications. Platformbased technologies  3.1.2. Platformbased technologies have specific features that have attracted the attention of the European  Commission159  (from  the  perspective  of  competition  policy160  but  also  of consumer  policy  and  other  fields161)  and  they  have  also  been  explored  by  national competition  authorities162.  In  general     platforms     are     twosided     or     multisided    markets163  where  a  platform  operator  brings users  together  to  facilitate  an  interaction such  as  an  exchange  of  information  or  a  commercial  transaction164.  Some  distinguish between    marketmakers    which bring together two distinct groups that are interested in trading     audience  makers     which  match  advertisers  to  audiences  and     demand coordinators    which coordinate the necessary infrastructure for the system to clear e.g. payments165. Platforms in FinTech services are linked with the access to information e.g. comparison websites and to commercial transactions as in the case of crowdfunding or crowdlending. The latter also generally fit within the category of    marketmakers    whilst the former belong to that of    audiencemakers   . Some operators of payment services could be characterised as     demand  coordinators     although  strictly  speaking  they  do  not  coordinate  demand themselves but rather its clearing. Unlike  more  linear  business  models  in  platforms  one  group  of  users  delivers  value  to another group and vice versa; in so doing they create value for the platform itself. This fluidity  of  interactions  and  the  need  to  adopt  a  multisided  perspective  means  that platforms can pose unique competition challenges. Due  to  its  multisided  character  the  relevant  market  cannot  be  defined  following traditional models built on the premises of    pipeline    businesses where value is generated by the supplier of a product or a service. This causes problems because the relevant market                                           159  https//ec.europa.eu/digitalsinglemarket/en/policies/onlineplatforms.  160  European Commission (2016a) & European Commission (2016b). 161  Ecorys (2017) & European Commission (2017). 162  Bundeskartellamt (2016). 163  Rochet J. & Tirole J.

PE 619.027 83  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  is defined by combining the product and geographical markets and the relevant product market    comprises all those products and/or services which are regarded as interchangeable or substitutable by the consumer by reason of the products    characteristics their prices and their intended use   166. In multisided markets the link between users affects the price elasticity on either side i.e. a price increase (or the corresponding reduction in quality) on one side reduces the value on the other side167. This creates a    chicken and egg problem    where both sides need to be attracted to the platform simultaneously and in reasonable proportions168. Thus at least in transaction platforms an argument can be made to consider the existence of  only  one  market  i.e.  the  intermediation  market  related  to  the underlying product  or service rather than a separate market for each product or service169. This approach has been followed in various cases170 by the Commission171 and it is the position of national competition authorities172. In the case of FinTech services the challenge of defining the relevant market may arise for instance in relation with mobile payments as the European Commission has highlighted in several competition decisions173. The  second  competition  challenge  resulting  from  the  combination  between  platform dynamics and users    perception and behaviour is the generation of network effects. This is possibly the most widely accepted phenomenon associated with platforms and the one that has been used as a if not    the    defining feature of these markets174. Positive network effects are present when the value of a product or service increases with the number of other users (positive direct network effect) but also when users in one group benefit from an increased presence of users from a different group (positive indirect network effects). Whereas platforms present direct network effects indirect network effects are their more distinctive feature especially in the case of multisided platforms. This feature sets them apart  from  other  types  of  markets  and  carries  with  it  important  implications  from  a competition perspective175. Platform  dynamics  are  wellknown  in  the  field  of     traditional     financial  services  such  as stock exchanges and other trading venues    Indirect network effects    are a major factor of    market liquidity    defined as the ease with which assets are traded which depends on the number of parties ready to buy or sell. This in turn is a critical component of financial stability176.  In  that  context  however  the  tension  between  liquidity  and  stability  and competition  between  platforms  to  provide  a  better  service  is  dealt  with  as  an  issue  of financial regulation177 rather than a competition issue.

(2013).  84 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) the markets    regulatory design rather than being left to competition tools which generally operate on an ex post basis to correct misconducts is a testimony to its importance and recurrence. FinTech platforms are not as regulated as financial trading platforms and therefore the challenges arising from network effects constitute a competition challenge that needs to be addressed without the benefit of a fully developed body of rules. These challenges include the  risk  that  multisided  network  effects  enable  a  large  platform  to  be  insulated  from competition from smaller platforms with fewer participants178 and can create barriers of entry179.  Yet  network  effects  do  not  per  se  determine  the  existence  of  competition problems in need of specific action. Other factors may modulate the intensity and features of  these  network  effects  in  a  way  that  makes  intervention  unnecessary.  The  nature  of network effects depends on the use of the platform. It is particularly relevant whether users tend to choose one provider only or several providers (   singlehoming    vs    multihoming   ). The decision may be influenced by factors such as the asymmetry of network effects on different sides of the platform the degree of differentiation and the cost to switch. Multihome platform markets lower the barriers of entry and reduce market power180 even if there is a dominant player181. The  ease  of  switching  between  services  is  one  of  the  advantages  offered  by  Fintech services over traditional financial services; this lowers the intensity of use. Keeping in mind the typically cautious approach by users on different sides the context tends to favour a    multihoming    system where neither fundseekers nor fundproviders    put all their eggs in a  single  basket     as  is  the  case  in  the  field  of  banking  through  crowdfunding  and crowdlending. Additionally the presence of FinTech services providers reduces the market power of established players in traditional services. Since these players have not opted for a FinTech model to provide their own services they have not been able to exploit their incumbency power which makes it difficult to observe any imminent problem of market power acquired through network effects. In services characterised by a more intensive use such as payments there is a greater tendency  towards  singlehome  platforms.  Since  FinTech  services  have  not  yet  replaced traditional services however users have a wider range of options. Thus a discussion of the potential acquisition of market power by newcomers using platform technology remains premature.  Nonetheless  the  risk  lies  in  the  exploitation  of  their  position  by incumbents  be  it  large  financial  institutions  or  big  technology  companies  to  deny newcomers access to the market. Yet this risk arises more because of access to data rather than the use of platforms as will be explained below. The importance of network effects also helps when it comes to understanding the kind of competition challenges related to the users    perspective of access and operations. Since network effects increase with the intensity of use and with singlehome platforms operators have a strong incentive to move towards a singlehome environment. If this is done by improving the service and catering to the user   s needs it is a procompetitive effect. Singlehome however can also be achieved by or result in anticompetitive forces.                                            178  Federal Trade Commission (2016 p. 26). 179  Robles A.

See 17. also PE 619.027 85  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  increase  switching  costs  by  modifying the  platforms    Platform  operators  can interoperability182. Interoperability normally requires a converter software that functions as an adapter or gateway183 which imposes extra costs with no clear benefits. An easily interoperable platform is more open and provides easier user access but it also makes the platform  more  vulnerable.  Larger  firms  have  fewer  incentives  to  make  their  networks compatible184. Especially in young markets with potentially high growth established players will  try  to  avoid  interoperability  with  smaller  rivals.  Established  players  will  attempt interoperability only if the entry is easy and the new entrants have a superior proprietary technology in which case it may be desirable for the incumbent to pursue an oligopoly with compatibility185.  An  active  pursuit  of  noninteroperability  e.g.  through  a  credible commitment to noninteroperability can act as a deterrent with anticompetitive effects if access to the market is difficult or costly. The reverse however is not necessarily true. Full interoperability and compatibility do not always  lead  to  a  better  service  or  have  procompetitive  effects.  If  interoperability  is achieved through technical compromises this may hinder the quality of service186. In other cases  firms  may  pursue  a  strategy  of  standardisation  to  lower  the  costs  of interoperability.  If  standardisation  lowers  entry  costs  and  prices  and/or  allows  firms  to compete  on  more     core     parts  of  the  service  it  has  a  positive  effect.  Standardisation however may also result in a restriction of competition between the technologies used for the provision of the service and an oligopoly187 where providers may take the opportunity to split the market between them.  Box 5  Antitrust investigation on the standardisation process for epayments In  September  2011  the  European  Commission  opened  an  antitrust  investigation  to evaluate  the  standardisation  process  of  epayments  undertaken  by  the  European Payments Council (EPC). The EPC is an international organisation created in 2002 and formed  of  PSPs  mostly  banks  and  associations  of  PSPs.  The  EPC  sought  to  develop standards to ensure the interoperability between epayments schemes within the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). According to the European Commission it    had concerns that through its work on standards for epayments and in particular the ePayments Framework  the  EPC  could  exclude  new  entrants  not  linked  to  a  bank  from  the  epayments market   188. In 2012 the EPC abandoned the developments of the draft SEPA ePayments  Framework  to  launch  a  wider  debate  among  all  stakeholders  on  how  to create  a  secure  epayment  ecosystem  in  the  SEPA  area189.  As  a  result  the  plaintiff company Sofort AG withdrew its complaint and the Commission decided to close the investigation.                                             182  Katz M. & Shapiro C.

The  second  technology  feature  that  characterises  FinTech  services  from  a  supplyside perspective is the use of dataintensive technologies. The use of data has attracted the attention  of  the  European  Commission190  and  national  competition  authorities  both inside191  and  outside  the  EU  most  notably  the  US192.  Big  data  or  more  generally technologies for the massive processing and analysis of data have been identified as a prevalent source of competition challenges. Still three precisions are important  (1)  Aside  from  these  challenges  data  technologies  have  also  been  considered  the  root cause of other socially relevant issues related to but not fully captured by competition e.g. social inclusion/exclusion193. (2)  Specific studies by competition authorities tend to mix problems that are characteristic to  dataintensive  technologies  with  problems  involving  the  technology  typically platform technology194 used to gather the data. (3)  From a user   s perspective in the field of data technologies the challenges associated with  the  technology   s  operation  are  more  deeply  intertwined  with  the  challenges associated with the users    behaviour since the way the technology operates will depend on the user   s behavioural patterns. Starting from the perspective of users    perception and behaviour the first competition challenge is the status of data as a source of market power. This is the origin of most other challenges. In many services an increased availability of data improves the accuracy of predictions about user   s preferences profitability and risk. This makes it easier to cater to their needs and devise tailormade pricing strategies that mitigate adverse selection i.e. avoid driving    good    customers away with onerous conditions while keeping the riskier ones.  In this context it is important to differentiate between    firstparty data    which are directly gathered  by  the  services  provider  because  they  are  voluntarily  given  by  an  actual  or prospective customer or as a result of an observation of interactions with that customer and    thirdparty data    which are collected by a third party195. While buying thirdparty data is possible in theory it may be impossible to match the data trove  of  certain  incumbents  e.g.  search  engines  or  other  big  tech  companies.  These companies may use their privileged data access to acquire a dominant position in any field of services that requires such data including financial services. Together with other barriers of  entry  such  as  network  effects196  a  privileged  access  to  data  can  protect  certain incumbents  from  competition197  an  insulation  that  may  be  perpetuated  by  the  need  of constant investment in technology to create ever more perfect algorithms. Thus  the  potential  of  data  to  help  incumbents  establish  an  unassailable  competitive advantage needs to be borne in mind as a relevant factor when assessing a merger e.g. if the combination of datasets would give access to such a unique data trove that it could                                           190  Vestager M.

On these grounds the DoJ sought to unwind the acquisition of PowerReviews Inc by Bazaarvoice. PE 619.027 87  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  give rise to competition concerns198. This can also be a cause of concern when such access results from a preexisting regulatory privilege e.g. if the entity is a former monopoly as outlined by the German and French competition authorities199. Control over unique data troves resulting from the combination of datasets from multiple sources  should  also  be  one  of  the  main  factors  in  assessing  potentially  anticompetitive conduct for example the conclusion of exclusive contracts or tying and bundling of services if the incumbent uses its control over a particularly valuable dataset to create a network of contracts that forecloses competition or to leverage its position and impose the use of other services200. These considerations raise two other sources of concern from opposite angles. One is the risk  that  incumbents  could  manipulate  user  behaviour  to  not  make  data  available  to competitors and the other is exclusionary conducts. Incumbents  can  exploit  the  need  of  users     consent  to  restrict  competitors     access  to customer  data.  In  the  case  of  payment  services  banks  are  obliged  by  recent  rules  to facilitate access to customer data to PSPs including FinTech companies as described in section 2.3.2. The practice of    screenscrapping    however is prohibited (see Box 1) i.e. PSPs  cannot  access  data  from  the  customer  payment  account  beyond  those  explicitly authorised by the customer. This means that banks may confront their customers with the possibility  to  choose  to  consent  access  to  their  data  in  unfavourable  terms  so  that customers refuse and competitors are excluded. Another way to create a lockin of users by preventing competitors    access to data may be to put up obstacles to data portability so that users are incapable of migrating their profile from one services provider to a different one201. Incumbents would have an incentive to present obstacles to data portability as a necessary part of the service to ensure quality and security and users could be persuaded of the need for a more intensive use in order to receive a better service. This in turn may make the system more closed. It is important to stress that competition rules by themselves may be insufficient to ensure that incumbents are not insulated from competition. Under competition rules a refusal of access  only  constitutes  anticompetitive  conduct  in  cases  of     essential  facilities     or    indispensable    products or services202. These concepts are quite restrictive and may not apply to datasets. For instance in the Bronner case the Court of Justice ruled that a product or service is indispensable if there are no alternative products or services and there are obstacles technical or otherwise which make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for the firm operating in the downstream market to develop products or services without access to  the  indispensable  ones  in  the  upstream  market203.  In  the  age  of  big  data  where advanced  data  capture  techniques  allow  for  the  creation  of  valuable  datasets  at  a reasonable cost it is difficult to consider a dataset as    indispensable   . In the field of payment                                           198  This was an important factor in the European Commission Decision in the Merger Control Procedure Case No COMP/M.6314     Telef  nica UK/ Vodafone UK/ Everything Everywhere JV 4 September 2012 where several competitors would combine datasets in a joint venture. 199  Autorit   de la concurrence & Bundeskartellamt (2016 p. 20).

The  second  set  of  concerns  can  arise  in  the  opposite  case  i.e.  where  the  market  is transparent and user data is relatively easy available. In such a case the problem may arise because of the use of computer algorithms in a way that promotes express and tacit collusion algorithms can be used to find noncompetitive price equilibria204 implement agreements detect deviations and implement automatic reactions to market conditions205. Such conduct may even result not from the conscious behaviour of competitors but from other  circumstances  such  as  using  the  same  services  provider  for  the  databased algorithms206. In the extreme with constant technological advances the use of machinelearning or AI algorithms to determine prices and services conditions can result in parallel practices. This is not because of any express or tacit horizontal or vertical agreement but because of the interdependency between operators207. The aforementioned challenges are identifiable as problems related to users    behaviour and the data resulting from it. Yet these are intimately related with the challenges identifiable from a perspective of the users    access and operation of the technology. Since data is a source of market power incumbents have an incentive to make it difficult for others to introducing  obstacles  to access  and  use  the  technology  of  newcomers  by interoperability.  This  can  be  considered  in  the  case  of  payment  services208  where  banks  have  to  grant access to their customers    data to PSPs. Since    screen scraping    is prohibited banks must have a communication channel in place that allows TPPs to access data identify each other and communicate through secure channels. This may be accomplished by adapting bank customers    online interfaces or creating a new dedicated interface209. In either case a bank has no clear incentive to make the necessary investments to ensure that the interface works swiftly or that its technology and the technology of the TPP operate smoothly with each other. In practice obstacles to access users    data by competitors can be combined with obstacles for  users  to  access  another  providers     technology210.  The  portability  of  data  can  be manipulated to influence user behaviour.  A  different  problem  from  the  exclusion  of  competitors  is  the  exclusion  of  users themselves. This is a particular concern in the US where the use of Consumer Reporting Agencies  (CRAs)  to  determine  eligibility  for  access  to  credit  employment  insurance housing etc based on credit scoring is widespread211. Big data can help some users to access services that would not be available for    unscorable    users. Yet it can also result in unjustified exclusions due to the actions of the group where the user is classified or existing inequalities being reinforced212.                                           204  In the United States see US Department of Justice (2015).

PE 619.027 89  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  More  difficult  to  assess  than  user  exclusion  is  price  discrimination.  The  same  data algorithms  that  exclude  users  or  reinforce  disparities  can  result  in  differentiated  prices including maximum prices i.e. the maximum price that a user is ready to pay depending on user characteristics. This can be worrying if algorithms discriminate in accordance with features unrelated to the service or job e.g. zip code213 or features that act as a proxy for other factors that result in illegal discrimination e.g. race or religion. Price discrimination however can also grant access to services to certain users who would otherwise have no such possibility say by lowering the interest rate of credit contracts to users exhibiting certain features that predict a higher probability of returning a loan214. This also allows for enhanced competition since providers can offer lower prices to users that show preference for other services as a strategy to compete for those customers215. Competition challenges falling outside competition policy tools 3.1.4. The explanatory matrix also helps to identify the instances where there may be an overlap between competition tools and other tools and thus might have to be solved by other instruments which lie beyond the scope of competition policy. Beginning with the top right corner in FinTech services based on platform technologies (supplyside) the challenges of  defining  the  relevant  market  and  network  effects  are  largely  determined  by  the (demandside) factors of user perception e.g. about the substitutability between different services and user behaviour e.g. intensity of use or singlehome vs. multihome use. Such  factors  can  be  addressed  through  competition  policy  tools  but  also  by  noncompetition  policy  tools.  User   s  perception  of  a  certain  service  can  depend  on  the transparency of the provider which in turn depends on the disclosure duties applicable to service providers. Likewise these duties can influence user behaviour e.g. more complex disclosure  protocols  can  foster  intensity  of  use  and  singlehoming.  However  these  are investor protection provisions which impose certain duties on financial intermediaries such as MiFID II216 or comparable regulations. Moving  to  the  top  left  corner  of  the  matrix  and  thus  still  within  the  field  of  platform technologies user access and operation of the technology depend on entry costs. Yet a major part of entry costs is related to regulatory requirements if they impose a burden on  operators  or  conversely  if  their  absence  creates  a  situation  of  uncertainty  and unpredictability. Rules on payment services for example stipulate a licensing process but provide  certain  safeguards  that  must  be  respected  and  which  customers  can  take  for granted when accessing the service. Mandatory rules can also require the compatibility and interoperability between different types of services like financial market rules impose the interoperability of trading clearing and settlement services. All these elements however are part of licensing and regulatory requirements and do not belong to the field of competition law instruments. Considering the bottom right corner of the matrix where dataintensive technologies are analysed from the perspective of user behaviour we discussed that the role of data as a source of market power is largely influenced by users    decisions to provide their data. Regardless of the solution that may be more appropriate for fostering competition this will always be subject to the provisions of data protection and privacy laws217 and thus the                                           213  Federal Trade Commission (2016a p. 11). 214  This is particularly important since disadvantaged collectives tend to be more price sensitive. See Executive Office of the President of the United States (2015). 215  Autorit   de la concurrence & Bundeskartellamt (2016 p. 22). 216  Directive 2004/39/EC    Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)     and Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II). 217  Data protection is considered a fundamental right in the EU. See article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The safeguards for the protection of the right are contained in Regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016  90 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) full scope of the issue exceeds the boundaries of competition policy tools218. Privacy and data protection rules must ensure that user consent is central to the system. This does not mean mere formal consent users need to understand and be made aware of all relevant information to give their consent219.  Increased  awareness  does  not  need  to  lead  to  more  restriction  in  accessing  data  (by providers) and services (by users). Better information can facilitate consumer access to additional services if the providers have access to the data stored by incumbents. In some cases the balance between the interest of the new entrant the incumbent and the user is complex enough to have been the subject of specific regulations outside data protection. An example are the financial regulatory provisions for PSPs which also regulate the access by PSPs to the data stored by established financial institutions e.g. the bank where the client  has  his/her  current  account  and  mortgage  loan  and  receives  his/her  salary payments220.  The  rules  try  to  ensure  access  to  customers     payment  data  to  TPPs.  The consequences of the application of these rules are relevant for competition and competition law instruments can be a useful mechanism to foster compliance with regulatory rules221. The rules themselves however exceed the scope of competition policy and thus the scope of the present study. Finally  within  dataintensive  technologies  when  we  consider  the  perspective  of  user access  the  ease  of  access  and  operation  by  the  user  is  determined  by  pure  technical factors  e.g.  how  well  the  technologies  of  a  bank  and  a  payment  services  provider interoperate as well as more subjective factors such as whether the payment interface is userfriendly.  Issues  such  as  the  layout  of  the  information  and  the  transparency  of  the conditions are a matter where consumer protection laws222 and similar transparencyoriented rules applicable to providers of information society services223 weigh heavily. Then the restrictions on the design of the technology especially the algorithms in ways that do not unfairly exclude or discriminate against certain types of consumers are not exclusive or predominantly a matter for competition tools. Fundamental rights are at stake especially the right to nondiscrimination224. 3.1.5. The competition policy decision tree as a normative tool to assess the challenges and the instruments to address them The explanatory matrix classifies the different competition challenges from a supplyside and demandside perspective but as said before225 it has no independent normative force. That is the matrix itself cannot help to determine whether the challenge is real or                                           on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). 218  Court of Justice of the European Union (2006). 219  Recital  (32)  of  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  states  that     Consent  should  be  given  by  a  clear affirmative act establishing a freely given specific informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her such as by a written statement including by electronic means or an oral statement.   . 220  See articles 6477 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the internal market amending Directives 2002/65/EC 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC (Payment Services Directive II).  221  Khan M. & Shotter J.

To do that a normative process is needed.  This should include a systematic assessment of the competition challenges and the potential use of competition law instruments in contrast to other legal regulatory or policy tools which may be appropriate in each case. Figure 44 shows the key questions that must be answered to decide the best way for addressing each dynamic which together form the    competition policy decision tree   .

Even if one answers this first question in the affirmative it is necessary to ask whether the challenge is an actual competition challenge or whether it falls squarely into other categories of challenge. A negative answer to the question would place the specific issue squarely into other domains such as regulation data protection etc. In the case of the answer to the question being mixed the answer should be counted as a    yes   . The next question particularly for those cases that are mixed in nature is whether the challenge  may  be  addressed  using  sectoral  or  crosssectoral  regulatory  tools  and/or competition policy tools. For those cases where the challenge may be addressed by specific sectoral or crosssectoral regulation  the  next  question  is  whether  the  current  sector  specific  regulatory framework is suitable to cope with the issue. If the answer is    yes    the difficulty may be in the application and enforcement of the rules in which case that process should be improved.  If  the  answer  is     no     the  problem  will  be  the  inadequacy  of  the  regulatory framework in which case the solution should be the amendment of that framework in a way that addresses existing challenges. In either case the specific solution would need to be  discussed  in  more  depth  in  relation  to  the  specific  service  and  it  would  be complementary to a solution based on competition tools. For  those  cases  where  the  answer  to  the  regulatory  question  is     no     there  will  be  a competition challenge which may not be addressed with regulatory tools. This means that competition tools will be the best if not the only available instrument to address the challenge.  The  type  of  competition  tool  depends  on  the  characteristics  of  the  problem standardisation  challenges  or  collusion  resulting  from  algorithms  or  AI  can  be  tackled through the tools used for collusive agreements or behaviour market power challenges arising from platform technology or the use of data may be best addressed through merger control  exclusionary  conduct  can  be  removed  using  the  tools  for  collusion  or  abuse  of dominant position etc. In most cases the conclusion to the first two questions seems to be    no    or a tentative and tepid    yes   . The market for certain types of services is in its infancy or in a state of flux which makes it difficult to reach a conclusion as to the existence of clear challenges that may or should be addressed by competition tools. There are however several examples where regulatory tools or other types of noncompetition tools seem warranted. 3.2. The  use  of  descriptive  and  normative  tools  to  assess  challenges  and possible courses of action on a service by service basis 3.2.1. Deploying descriptive and normative tools on the servicebyservice analysis the resulting competition dynamics The key to describing the existing competitive landscape in FinTech services and assessing present  and  potential  challenges  entails  several  steps.  The  most  relevant  step  involves combining  the  more abstract view  of  competition  issues  based  on  a  supplyside  that captures the characteristic technologies and a demandside that takes into account how a service  or  technology  is  accessed  and  operated  and  how  the  consumers  perceive  and behave in relation to it with a more concrete view that considers the actual services involved  based  on  the  categories  employed  in  section  2.  This  gives  rise  to  a  series  of competition dynamics which are discussed in subsequent points. The following table may serve as a summary. The column    Problems    reflects classic competition issues that can occur in any economic sector and that can also affect the FinTech services. The column    Causes    includes the potential dynamics with a sectorspecific approach that might lead to PE 619.027 93  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  the  anticompetitive  practices  listed  in  the  column     Problems   .

PE 619.027 95  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  Banking     marketplace lending 3.2.2. Our analysis shows that marketplace lending faces significant challenges that may hinder the development of a competitive market. The perception is that the main obstacles are not a result of anticompetitive behaviour but a lack of clear regulatory standards applicable to this type of activity. This poses at least three different concerns. First in some cases new entities may have to confront multiple and often conflicting regulations which prevent  them  from  scaling  up  within  the  Digital  Single  Market.  Second  in  other  cases incumbents may face important regulatory costs while their unregulated competitors can provide services functionally equivalent to theirs without having to bear the same costs leveraging an uneven playing field. Third leaving the cost dimension aside regulatory rules help to safeguard important interests such as investor protection or financial stability which may be jeopardised by the presence of unregulated activities growing unchecked. These views seem to be shared across EU institutions and agencies. The FinTech Action plan  recently  unveiled  by  the  European  Commission  for  example  frames  the  issue  in regulatory terms emphasizing the patchwork of regulations currently applied to FinTech companies  (first  concern)  and  promoting  a  passportbased  system  of  common  rules  for those market players that decide to operate as European crowdfunding service providers227. The recent EBA   s Roadmap on FinTech for its part emphasises the need to monitor the regulatory  perimeter  and  emerging  trends  that  may  impact  institutions     prudential risks as well as the need to address consumer issues (second and third concerns)228. Both the Commission and the EBA emphasise the need to identify best practices in the use of sandboxes as the best way to achieve innovation while mitigating FinTech risk229. The plans though do not circumscribe their use to platformbased lending or any particular type of Fintech service. These and similar challenges are not ones that may be addressed by competition tools or where competition tools may play a decisive role. The problem lies in the inadequacy and uncertainty of the substantive content of regulatory rules and can only be addressed by means of regulatory policies230. That does not mean that issues typically associated with competition tools are irrelevant for  banking  FinTech  services.  Being  platformbased  technologies  their  activity  is characterised by the kind of challenges generally associated with this type of technology i.e. the definition of the relevant market as well as network effects.  At present crowdlending platforms not only compete with other platforms but also with incumbent players such as banks which enjoy much larger volumes and name recognition an opinion shared by different market players. This results in platform markets that are primarily multihome and do not have a high intensity of use i.e. neither borrowers nor  investors  use  a  single  platform  for  purposes  of  raising  or  investing  money  nor  do platforms  require  a  high  intensity  of  use  which  may  promote  the  gradual  captivity  of clients.  If  such  trends  were  to  become  more  worrisome  they  would  be  in  specific  niche markets which is why the diversity of crowdlending should be regularly monitored. Of potential importance for marketplace lending in the medium term could be the current emphasis on interoperability and standardisation in current proposals231. The European Commission is currently focusing on promoting interoperability in FinTech services. Present                                           227  European Commission (2018b pp. 5   6).

Hereafter EBA   s Fintech Roadmap. 229  European Commission (2018b pp. 8   9); European Banking Authority (2018 pp. 20   21). 230  See section 2.2.2. 231  European Commission (2018b p. 7).  96 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) efforts however seem more focused in the field of payment services (see below) and it is unclear  how  far  interoperability  (or  its  absence)  is  a  competitive  concern  in the  field  of marketplace lending which is why it is necessary to wait for further developments.  Finally  as  the  market  for  marketplace  lending  becomes  a  more  established  feature  in financial  services  the use of  algorithms  can  also  lead  to  phenomena  of financial exclusion232.  As  of  now  it  is  unclear  how  competition  policy  tools  rather  than regulatory tools e.g. fair access to credit rules233 or consumer protection tools may be the more suitable instruments to deal with the issue. Payments transfers and Forex 3.2.3. Payments services are the category of FinTech services that appears more clearly in the authorities    radar as shown by the recurring presence of payment operators in competition cases. FinTech payment services technologies are platformbased and databased and as such exhibit the kinds of challenges to be expected from each of them. Furthermore due to their greater frequency of use payment services are more prone to intensive singlehome models and are a large source of data for behavioural patterns that can be used  by  the  payment  services  provider  to  lever  its  position.  Firms  with  an  established position  in  the  market  for  payment  services  have  a  greater  incentive  to  lockin customers and use payment services as the entry point to offer other services tailored to customer  needs.  This  influences the  type  of competition  challenges  that  can  already  be observed those that may still be incipient and those that may be expected in the (nottoodistant) future. The first type of issue considered from the perspective of user perception and behaviour is market definition. In addition to this another relevant challenge is the dynamics of market power. Being both platformbased and databased there are different channels by  which  an  operator  can  acquire  or  enhance  its  market  power.  One  is  by  further fostering intensive singlehome use patterns. The other even more evident channel is using customer data to lever the competitor   s position including the crossusage of datasets to offer other services through tying and bundling. This could be the case for large technology companies and large financial companies. This risk seems to be greater in the case of large tech companies whose advanced data  technology  looks  suited  to  entrench  their  position.  In  payment  services  large  tech companies face an important competitive pressure from large financial companies but once they acquire an established position they are likely to exploit it. Recent experience with other services seems to display this very behaviour. Google   s practices in the distribution of mobile devices through its Mobile Application Distribution Agreement (MADA) show a tendency to foreclose competition to favour Android as the OS which is then used as the port  to  install  Googlemade  applications  (apps)  and  prevent  the  installation  of  other applications that can compete with its own234. This resulted in proceedings by the European Commission which ended in the imposition of fines worth EUR 2.4 billion among other measures for foreclosing competition in the field of comparison shopping services235. If a large  technology  firm  such  as  Google  which  is  dominant  in  the  field  of  OS  for  mobile                                           232  See section 3.1.3. 233  See e.g. the US Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) 15 U.S.C.      1691 et seq; Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) 15 U.S.C.      16811681x; or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act 1964. 234  Edelman B. & Geradin D.

PE 619.027 97  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  devices also becomes dominant in the field of payment services the pattern seems easy to replicate. In the case of large financial companies it is unclear whether and how far FinTech payment services pose a new challenge or are simply a new field where companies may try to entrench their position. The clearer and more immediate challenge is the use by large financial companies of an incumbency position gained offline to engage in exclusionary  conduct  towards  FinTech  competitors236.  This  poses  an  interesting interplay  between  regulatory  and  competition  rules  regarding  data  access.  The  key policies that act as countervailing weight to the need to promote competition are the needs to promote security and to protect customers    right to consent over and control their data. Since security and data protection issues exceed the boundaries of FinTech services from a competition or regulatory perspective the Commission   s approach consists of ensuring that the issue is the subject of further study through the creation of an expert  group  to  assess  the  existence  of  unjustified  regulatory  obstacles237.  At  present however it is concentrating its regulatory efforts on the development of market solutions for standardised APIs compliant with PSD2 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as a basis for a European open banking ecosystem as well as for more coordinated approaches on standards for FinTech238. Fostering an open banking ecosystem has been an initiative undertaken by national regulators such as the FCA in the UK239 but it is unclear what  implications  it  would  have  on  an  EUwide  scale  especially  in  terms  of  regulatory requirements to ensure access. For the moment competition policy tools seem to be used to enforce minimum standards i.e. the Commission   s use of competition tools seems to be the    stick    to dissuade from pure exclusionary behaviour against the    carrot    of aiding market standardsetting efforts. It is still unclear however how competition tools may work in a context primarily characterised by regulatory solutions. In the medium term and as standardised solutions are developed to ensure APIs interoperability it is important to be aware of the opposite kind of risk i.e. the use of standardisation as a means to engage in collusive behaviour one example being the Commission investigation on the EPC (See Box 5).  Digital currencies 3.2.4. Our research shows that the market for digital currencies is characterised by competition between currencies (intercryptocurrency market) and competition between exchanges (intracryptocurrency market)240. The intercryptocurrency market is characterised by both platforms and the presence of network  effects241  which  creates  entry  barriers  and  enhances  market  power242. Further research would be needed to determine whether this is accompanied by collusive behaviour  or  abuse  of  dominant  positions  in  order  to  dissuade  merchants  wallets  or exchanges from adhering to new currencies. When  choosing  to  closely  monitor  specific  market  developments  in  order  to  discover potential competition issues the standardisation of DLT and other technical protocols is a firm candidate. More worrysome may be the use of cryptocurrencies promoted by banks  even  by  central  banks  which  may  reshape  the  current  competition  level  in  the                                           236  Khan M. & Shotter J.

(2016 p. 6).  98 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) cryptocurrency  market.  These  types  of  cryptocurrencies  may  broaden  the  number  of competitors243  but  could  also  help  leverage  the  market  power  of  banks  in  traditional banking services. If banks decide to enter the field of cryptocurrency payments they may try to block access on interoperability grounds in a similar way to that observed in the market  for  payment  services.  Cryptocurrencies  developed  by  large  financial  players however are still at a relatively early stage and it is not possible to assess with any degree of certainty the type of competition challenges that they may pose in the medium term. The implications of the mining market for competition are hard to gauge. First it is a noncontestable market with few established players. Second it is not a traditional market since price is selfscheduled by the cryptocurrency   s own algorithm.  The wallet and payment market in digital currencies (which can be considered together given the increasingly blurred boundaries between them) does not seem to pose current competitive  challenges.  Switching  costs  or  technical  restrictions  could  prevent  users from moving from one wallet or exchange app to another; however the high number of providers and low barriers of entry244 mean that such actions would have a relatively low impact  in  the  market.  The  exchange  market  for  its  part  could  potentially  be  more worrysome  since  it  is  subject  to  a  degree  of  concentration  similar  to  the  mining market. This requires a careful monitoring of developments such as vertical or horizontal integration processes as well as exclusionary conduct towards other cryptocurrencies or their players.  Wealth and asset management 3.2.5. A study of the field of wealth and asset management services shows that the potentially troublesome  issues  from  a  competition  perspective  concern  (1)  the  fee  policies  of different  service  providers  which  seem  adamantly  high;  (2)  the  blurring  of  the boundaries between different types of services (information advisory management); and (3) the implications of the use of algorithms245. In the explanatory matrix these are issues primarily related to the interaction between dataintensive technologies and the users    perceptions and behaviours. From the normative perspective of the decision tree however the main difficulty lies in the initial questions i.e. whether and to what extent these are    competition issues    which    might not    (or should not) be addressed via regulatory tools.  The first example i.e. the high fees charged by advisory services is closely related to the users    lack of awareness of fee structures and mechanisms and their inability to compare which is a consequence of the lack of transparency in the field. Lack of transparency and conflicts of interest in fee structures however is hardly a new issue created by FinTech or a pure competition issue. It was the subject of some of the more important modifications of  the  regime  applicable  to  financial  intermediaries  resulting  from  MiFID  II  which considered the reception of fees or commissions as one of the key elements in determining whether investment advice can be considered    independent   246.

More  crucially  though  it  poses  challenges  for  regulatory  bodies  and  financial supervisory authorities which need to carefully consider the licensing regime to apply to each  provider  and  the  duties  resulting  from  investor  protection  rules.  Monitoring  the perimeter is a priority for the EBA which has been encouraged by respondents to its public consultation to    analyse further whether or not variations at the national level give rise to any level playing field or consumer protection issues   247. Yet this again is hardly a FinTech issue  or  even  a  new  issue.     Shadow  banking     the  term  often  used  to  label  issues concerning the regulatory perimeter have been in the Commission   s (regulatory) policy agenda for a long time248. Although the postcrisis concern was financial stability249 the user/investor  perspective  has  been  very  present  in  rules  such  as  those  for  Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs250) and more recently Money Market Funds (MMFs)251 which try to ensure that investors are aware of the type of service they are contracting and the risks involved in it. The issue that looks more promising from a competition policy perspective is the impact  of  algorithms  which  from  a  descriptive  perspective  results  from  the  dataintensive nature of the technology and cuts across user perspectives of perception and behaviour and the operation of the technology. The effects of the use of algorithms in the provision of FinTech wealth management services are mixed. On the one hand there are  procompetitive  effects  such  as  increased  transparency  on  both  price  and  quality variables as well as a more efficient development of products and services252. On the other hand there are risks that can arise such as the potential role of algorithms to be facilitating factors  for  coordination  and  collusion  (algorithmic  collusion)253.  These  effects  were discussed earlier254. The  presence  and  impact  of  such  algorithms  is  still  uncertain  and  needs  to  be monitored closely. Albeit algorithms raise genuine competition concerns it is unclear the respective roles that competition tools and regulatory tools may have in this field. The concept of    market manipulation    for example is long established as one of the pillars of the regime on market abuse255 which includes inter alia situations where the entities engaged in the manipulation seek to    secure a dominant position over the supply or demand    or is likely to have the effect of    fixing directly or indirectly purchase or sale prices    or create    other unfair trading conditions   256. Market abuse rules which are mostly applicable in an ex post enforcement setting however are not the only regulatory rules involved. MiFID II introduced specific rules on algorithmic trading which try to ensure that firms using it have proper builtin safeguards and that there are sufficient mechanisms in place to identify orders and mitigate disruption257. Thus from both ex ante prevention and ex  post  enforcement  perspectives  it  would  appear  that  despite  the  conduct   s  features                                           247  European Banking Authority (2018 p. 19). 248  See e.g. European Commission (2012) & European Commission (2013b). 249  See e.g. European Commission (2012 p. 2). 250  See e.g. articles 22 et seq. of Directive 2011/61/EU of June 2011 on Alternative Investment Fund Managers. 251  In Regulation 2017/1131 of 14 June 2017 on money market funds the    core    of the rules is the distinction between different types of funds which present different types of risks (most notably Constant Net Asset Value (CNAV) funds which are prone to    runs    in a way similar to banks) and the imposition of restrictions on eligible assets and diversification risk management and other procedures on funds that wish to be marketed with a certain designation towards investors. Thus the rules address what was arguably an issue of financial stability with investor protection measures. 252  OECD (2017). 253  OECD (2017 p. 16). 254  See section 2.5.2. 255  Articles 12 13 15 16 of Regulation 596/2014 of 16 April 2014 on market abuse (Market Abuse Regulation or MAR). 256  Article 12 (2) (a) MAR. 257  Article 17 MiFID II.  100 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) placing  it  squarely  within  the  field  of  competition  policy  financial  regulation  has  coopted the field. This coopting may be justified by reasons of the specialty of the market and the expertise of the supervisory institutions or simply by pathdependency issues e.g. it  is  more  natural  to  add  market  manipulation  to  the  set  of  rules  that  regulate  insider trading.  These factors lead to conclude that in the field of wealth and investment management there are a number of relevant regulatory issues with an impact on competition that the presence of algorithms raises genuine competition concerns but that the use of competition tools may still be unwarranted for reasons of sector specificity. Personal finance management 3.2.6. The field of PFM is closely linked to some of the issues already discussed in the field of payments. FinTech firms wishing to gain access to customer data often provide services of personal financial management which is why they need access to personal data in the first place. Denial of access by financial incumbents such as large banks poses a clear competition challenge as well as the use by technology incumbents such as large technology companies of their position as PSPs to offer other services. The former kind of challenge is being currently addressed by way of regulatory initiatives258 while the latter is still a potential but not imminent threat. To the extent that the lines between PFM and wealth management begin to blur the same type  of  concerns  e.g.  the  role  of  algorithms  may  arise  in  this  case.  Furthermore  the presence  of  algorithms  in  this  field  can  also  lead  to  phenomena  of  financial exclusion if data technologies are used in an unfair or discriminatory manner e.g. by shutting off certain users from certain services or offering them unfair conditions259. The relatively low penetration and intensity of use of this type of services however does not make the exclusion from them a pressing source of concern although this could change if they become the norm in personal financial management. Furthermore it is unclear how competition policy tools rather than for instance consumer protection tools may be the more appropriate instruments to deal with the issue. Insurance 3.2.7. Even if the type of services offered are different from wealth management the use of dataintensive  technologies  increases  the  supplyside  similarities  which  also  increases  the likelihood  that  the  same  type  of  competition  issues  may  arise.  The  insurance  sector however has been a relatively recent latecomer to the digital age260 which is why the  effects  of  algorithms  on  collusive  or  potentially  collusive  strategies  may come with a time lag. Large insurance companies are still slow to adopt new technologies and large technology firms are not interested in entering the field leaving all competitive pressure to newcomers that still need to build size and reputation. Given  that  the  position  of  incumbent  insurance  firms  is  strong  the  field  of  InsurTech services  could  witness  the  kind  of  competition  challenges  observed  in  fields  such  as payments  which  primarily  concern  interoperability  and  standardisation.  If  new nimbler  companies  may  provide  equivalent  services  at  a  lower  cost261  large  insurance firms have a strong incentive to create artificial barriers to entry. Thus competition authorities  should  be  particularly  attentive  to  agreements  on  information                                           258  See section 3.1.3. 259  Federal Trade Commission (2016a pp. 9   12). 260  Willis Towers Watson (2017). 261  Ralph O. (2017). PE 619.027 101  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  exchange  that  are  limited  to  established  companies  or  agreements  to  standardise technology e.g. blockchain standardisation agreements262. These concerns however far away are probable and a closer monitoring of the sector is needed. The fact that the impact of dataintensive technologies in the insurance sector is still in an early stage of evolution also renders speculative any exercise to allocate the response to the  challenges  between  regulation  and  competition  tools.  It  is  however  possible  to anticipate  that  the  two  would  need  to  be  consistent  with  each  other  and  advance  in  a parallel fashion. For example the question of what uses of blockchain technology in the design of smart insurance contracts would be considered legitimate needs an answer from the  perspective  of  competition  (to  determine  acceptable  standardisation  techniques) prudential  regulation  (to  assess  risks)  and  consumer  protection.  At  the  same  time competition authorities need to be vigilant about the risk that incumbent firms may use FinTech  to  exploit  their  already  existing  data  troves  and/or  to  engage  in  exclusionary conduct. Enabling technologies and infrastructures 3.2.8. Our  analysis  leads  to  conclude  that  most  markets  in  FinTech  services     enabling technologies  and  infrastructures  e.g.  DLTs  AI  and  Data  Analytics  as  well  as cybersecurity  pose  no  competition  concerns  with  many  providers  competing  in fragmented markets263. The only cause for concern is the market of advanced cloud services which is characterised by high entry costs due to the need for significant investments and the dominance of a restricted number of big tech companies. Since the portfolio of services offered is quite fluid and largely commoditised there is no present concern of anticompetitive behaviours. It is important however to closely monitor the services offered to aid in the effort of defining the relevant market which so far remains the main challenge.                                             262  Blockchain networks can be divided into    public blockchains    where anybody can join the network (the main example is Bitcoin) and    private blockchains    with restricted access to known participants.

CONCLUSIONS OF THE ASSESSMENT KEY FINDINGS      Technology has an important potential to disrupt established markets and unleash procompetitive  forces  by  lowering  barriers  of  entry.  Therefore  the  role  of anticompetitive  factors  needs  to  be  weighed  against  the  role  of  procompetitive forces before making an assessment.       Current efforts at the policy level should primarily focus on research and a close monitoring  of  market  developments.  Both  descriptive  and  normative  tools  are proposed to anticipate assess and manage competition issues as they occur.      The  response  to  the  challenges  may  lie  in  regulatory  measures  noncompetition measures or follow a hybrid approach depending on several factors such as the type of service and the maturity of the existing market.       Any financial regulatory reform should take into account competition considerations from the beginning. Both frameworks (regulatory and competition) should work in a more coordinated effort to ensure the healthy evolution of the FinTech ecosystem. General overview and analytical tools the type of services that can be offered;  the type of players that can compete to offer them;  the ways in which those services can be offered.  4.1. The  word  that  best  defines  the  current  state  of  FinTech  services  is     change   .  New technologies strongly affect  (1) (2) (3) This makes any attempt of prognosis tentative at best and sends a message of caution to policymakers. Technology has an important potential to disrupt established markets and unleash procompetitive forces by lowering barriers of entry making it easier for new players  to  compete     which  is  in  itself  positive.  Therefore  the  role  of  anticompetitive factors needs to be weighed against the role of procompetitive forces before making an assessment. Current  efforts  at  the  policy  level  should  primarily  focus  on  research  and  a  close monitoring  of  market  developments.  This  seems  to  be  the  approach  of  the  European Commission  or  the  EBA  whose  FinTech  action  plans  are  characterised  by  efforts  to understand  explore  monitor  or  broker  private  sector  solutions  instead  of  proposals  to regulate or intervene. The study uses both descriptive (explanatory matrix) and normative (competition policy decision tree) analysis to assess real or potential competition risks264. The current message of caution is not an obstacle for having adequate tools in place to gauge the impact of market developments in competition as they occur.  The role of regulation 4.2. If the current state of the markets for FinTech services is generally too fluid to reach firm conclusions on the existence of competition challenges the special role of regulation in                                           264  See sections 3.1 and 3.2. PE 619.027 103  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  the field of financial services sends a message of caution about the appropriateness of competition policy tools as the preferred means to address those challenges. Financial regulation is one of the primary entry barriers for these services but it is also the primary source of legal certainty. All market operators regardless of whether they demand  more  or  less  regulation  tend  to  ask  for  a  more  stable  legal  framework  for FinTech services which they see as one of the major competitive challenges. While being a competition issue it cannot be addressed by means of competition tools.  The conclusion that the initial response to these challenges may lie in regulatory measures rather than competition measures is shared for a number of different services such as banking/lending wealth and asset management and insurance. Others such as services related to digital currencies or PFM are still in an even earlier stage where the need for regulation is being assessed. In some cases the conclusions may be mixed. This is the case for the use of algorithms in wealth and asset management. The use of algorithms can give rise to genuine competition challenges  such  as  collusive  behaviour  (primarily)  and  abuse  of  dominant  position (potentially).  In  cases  where  trading  and  investment  is  a  regulated  activity  as  it  is  in financial markets even competition concerns tend to be captured by financial regulation through the rules on market abuse for example. The role of competition policy 4.3. If some services offer examples of pure regulatory problems or problems that despite their characterisation as competition problems can be addressed through regulatory or noncompetition measures other cases show that the opposite may be also true i.e. that a regulatory  problem  addressed  by  regulatory  provisions  may  nonetheless  be  aided through the use of competition policy tools. This is the case of payment services which is also the field where the actions of market incumbents are subject to more scrutiny. The lowering of barriers of entry by facilitating access to data has been a policy decision implemented through regulation such as PSD2 which is better suited than competition tools to stipulate the means by and conditions on which such access may be granted. The recent activity of competition authorities against large financial institutions for behaviours suggesting a denial of access to such data however suggests that competition tools may be deployed as a deterrent for firms that use customer consent or the interoperability of technologies to block competitors    access.  This type of hybridity of the tools used to address a competition problem should not be a surprise  in  a  field  like  payment  services.  Thanks to  the presence  of  platform  dynamics payment services offer the clearer field for the crystallisation of some of the competition concerns that have been identified by the proposed explanatory tools. Authorities need to be  particularly  alert  to  market  developments  which  may  suggest  that  large  technology companies  or  large  financial  companies  could  be  using  payment  services  to  lockin customers and tie and bundle other services while refusing access to other competitors. The current level of competition in the FinTech ecosystem does not suggest the need for any urgent change regarding the competition policy tools. Yet since FinTech competition challenges  are  explained  by  the  features  of  the  technology  used  to  deliver  them  i.e. platforms  and  dataintensive  technologies  a  broader  perspective  on  those  technologies could  justify  such  changes  on  a  larger  scale  not  only  focused  on  FinTech  services.  For instance  in  a  report  on  the  challenges  of  digital  markets  the  German  Commission  on Monopolies265  proposed  changes  to  competition  legal  tools.  These  proposals  included  a                                           265 Monopolkommission (2015 p. 131).  104 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) modification of the thresholds for notifications in merger control procedures to take into account the large purchase prices agreed by tech companies in acquisitions of competitors which may predict future incumbency gains. The study also proposes a reform of procedural rules to avoid the use of commitment procedures i.e. when the subjects of the investigation commit to undertake certain actions to meet the concerns of competition authorities to give closure to cases whose assessment may vary due to changes in market circumstances. The  need  for  such  profound  changes  may  seem  more  justified  if  the  focus  is  placed  on services such as search engines or social networks where there is a stable market with large incumbents and less contestability rather than on FinTech services where the market is more fluid.  Competition considerations in regulatory policy reform 4.4. The above analysis strikes a balance between the opportunity of using existing or modified competition tools to address FinTech competition challenges and the need to let the industry evolve. The state of the industry does not justify on its own a largescale deployment or reform of competition tools. Competition authorities should be vigilant in case the market develops some of the potential competition threats described in this study and they should be ready to use competition tools even in aid of goals already enshrined in regulatory rules.  The above also leads to one final conclusion the FinTech ecosystem shows the need for a more symbiotic relation between regulatory and competition frameworks which is presently  insufficient.  In  FinTech  payments  banking  wealth  and  asset  management  or financial advice goals such as financial stability and confidence consumer protection or data protection need to work seamlessly with the protection of competition. It is unclear how the current framework ensures the levels of coordination that would be necessary to minimise  friction.  The  Commission   s  FinTech  Action  plan  is  generally  vague  about  how competition considerations will be incorporated in the reform process with only one explicit reference to the need to ensure that standardisation for interoperability purposes has a procompetitive effect266. The EBA   s FinTech Roadmap is no more explicit and only refers to  the  need  to  promote     equal  competition     and  its  relationship  with  technological neutrality267. It would be desirable that the plans for future regulatory developments could provide a clearer vision of how competition considerations will be incorporated into the process and whether the voice of competition authorities will somehow be present. If both frameworks are to work seamlessly coordination needs to be present from their inception. Consistency should  be  sought  in  the  solutions  envisaged  for  say  access  to  data  or  transparency towards customers. If both regulatory and competition frameworks were reformed to reflect the need of a more flexible approach where situations can be more quickly reassessed considering market developments such reforms should be consistent with each other.  In this respect FinTech could be used as an example of the greater need to incorporate a competition  approach  into  financial  regulation.  This  was  present  in  a  first  stage  of  EU harmonisation prompted by the need to achieve the single market but as the financial crisis hit and financial stability took centre stage competition considerations became less present. FinTech offers a fertile ground to reopen the dialogue between regulatory and competition goals principles and frameworks which could help rebalance financial regulation policies towards a more procompetitive stance.                                           266  European Commission (2018b p. 7). 267  European Banking Authority (2018 p. 11).

METHODOLOGY The  analysis  was  performed  using  the  open  source  statistic  program  R  and  the  Rstudio environment275. We have used several R packages to perform the analysis276.  Analysis of the size and characteristics of the FinTech market  From the demand and market size point of view data regarding the European market is quite limited. This report gathers the most updated data available at the moment of elaboration (May  2018).  Data  came  from  secondary  sources  mainly  from  consultancy  and  industry reports such as Capgemini EY PwC or Deloitte or international organizations such as the World Bank. Consultancy reports tended to focus on specific aspects of the FinTech market such as the characterisation of the user (age level of digital skills etc.) or its preferences for usage of services and disposition to shift to new service providers and did not have a recurrent character. The last available report on each topic has been used. Data from the World Bank was extracted on May 2018.  Analysis of the structure of FinTech service providers  The quantitative analysis is based on the Crunchbase data base277 considered one of the most  valuable  startup  information  platforms  which  provides  information  to  help  others discover industry trends acquisitions investments and news about global companies in all sectors278 by using a    unique and scalable approach to data collection leveraging a strong community of contributors the largest venture partner network and inhouse data teams armed with powerful machine learning   279. This information not only allows for the collection of  data  regarding  European  FinTech  industry  but  also  allows  for  comparison  with  other selected countries.  The  data  was  downloaded  on  11th  of  January  2018.  On  that  date  the  Crunchbase database  whose  information  can  be  analysed  by  categories  provided  a  total  of 4 359 companies  worldwide  that  are  labelled  as  FinTech  companies.  For  the  study  the FinTech category is the only one selected. Companies whose operating status is indicated as closed are not included. Since companies are usually classified in more than one category all firms were reclassified by hand to improve the accuracy of the analysis by assigning one single  precise  category  according  to  the  services  described  in  section  1.2.  After  a  careful assessment of these companies280 up to 507 companies although defined as FinTech did not clearly engage in activities that were related to the use (or development) of innovative technologies  that  provided  financial  services.  As  a  result  these  companies  that  were  not considered to be FinTech were excluded. Therefore the total number of FinTech companies included in the dataset was 3 852 from 93 countries.                                             275  R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

If its activities do not match any of the FinTech categories defined the company was discarded.  124 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) Table 11  Number of FinTech companies by country Country Number  Country Number United States 1 491 United Kingdom India Canada Spain Australia Germany Singapore China France Israel Switzerland Ireland The Netherlands Hong Kong South Africa Brazil Sweden Russia Turkey Mexico 454 158 129 100 95 90 81 74 64 57 55 52 51 45 41 37 33 28 23 22                      PE 619.027 125 Portugal Egypt Kenya Romania Cayman Islands Norway Uruguay Malta Uganda Bangladesh Hungary Mauritius Morocco Tunisia Bermuda Bulgaria Europe Greece Kuwait Pakistan Senegal 7 6 6 6 5 5 5 4 4 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2  Policy Department A Economic and Scientific Policy  Country Denmark Japan Belgium Poland Finland Indonesia Italy Ukraine Nigeria South Korea Malaysia Philippines Argentina Czech Republic Luxembourg New Zealand Cyprus Chile Number 20 18 17 17 16 15 14 14 13 13 12 12 11 11 11 11 10 10 United Arab Emirates  10 Estonia Latvia Thailand 9 9 9                        Country Slovenia Taiwan Albania Armenia Bahrain Barbados Belarus Botswana Cambodia Cameroon Costa Rica Ecuador Georgia Ghana Isle of Man Jordan Kyrgyzstan Lebanon Panama Peru Qatar Rwanda Number 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  126 PE 619.027   Country Austria Colombia Vietnam Lithuania Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) Number 8 8 8 7      Country Number Seychelles Slovakia Zambia 1 1 1 Unknown 255 TOTAL  3 852  Source Compiled by the authors based on Crunchbase (2018b).  The following different analyses have been made      Numbers of companies by country/region The  analysis  was  based  on  the  countries  where  the  headquarters  are  located.  Data  of 3 852 FinTech companies were collected from the query in Crunchbase.  To provide a detailed overview of the FinTech industry in the EU compared to other countries the study focused on those countries which have the largest number of FinTech companies in  the  world.  The  number  of  companies  in  the  regions  or  countries  included  in  the benchmarking (Australia Canada EU28 China India Singapore and the US) was 3 048 out of a total of 3 852 FinTech organisations. These companies should be considered a significant sample  of  the  total  number  of  FinTech  related  companies  and  not  the  actual  number  of companies.      Size of the companies by number of employees by country/region The  analysis  was  made  for  the  EU  and  6  other  countries  with  a  high  number  of  FinTech companies namely the US India Canada Australia Singapore and China. To know the size of the companies the variable used was the number of employees whose information was classified in 6 categories ranging from    110    to    more than 500   .      Years of companies The analysis was made for the same six countries and the EU. In this case it was focused on the  years  since  the  constitution  of  the  company.

Category    Other    includes those FinTech companies from Crunchbase database that do not fit well into the remaining categories. The companies were manually classified based on the description of the companies and the default Crunchbase dataset categories. This task lead as indicated above to the exclusion of more than 500 companies from the dataset that should not be considered as FinTech.

This dataset was used to analyse the number and type of funding rounds the money raised per company and its yearly evolution and the level of investments in the sector by type of service and region/country.  We focused on the proportion of funding rounds out of the total funding rounds in countries and  regions  and  by  the  type  of  funding  (related  to  the  stage  of  the  funding  round).

Acquisitions of FinTech companies The analysis was made for the same six countries and the EU. Crunchbase provided detailed information on acquisitions including data about the acquired and the acquiring company (category  country  etc.)  and  the  date  of  acquisition  since  1997.  The  total  number  of acquisitions of FinTech companies among the selected countries in the dataset was 214 from 18 countries after all the filters were applied. An additional analysis was made depending on the  sector  of  the  acquiring  company.  Three  sectors  were  selected  Financial  sector Technology sector and FinTech sector (companies that are in both sectors). Different analyses were made. The first analysis was to compare the percentage of acquiring companies and the percentage of companies that had an initial public offering (IPO) between the different countries and the EU. Second was to check whether there was geographical endogamy  in  the  acquisitions.  Third  was  the  assessment  of  the  relationship  between  the sector of the acquiring company (financial FinTech and technology) and the type of service provided by the FinTech acquired company. The results are presented in network graphs to facilitate the interpretation of the findings.     130 PE 619.027   Competition issues in the Area of Financial technology (FinTech) Table 14  Acquisitions  by  country/region  of  the  acquired  company  and  the acquiring company Country/region  of  Acquiring Company Country/region  of  Acquired Company Asia Asia Asia Asia Australia Australia Australia Canada Canada Europe Europe Europe Other Other US US US US US TOTAL China EU28 India US Australia Singapore US Canada US Canada EU28 US EU28 US Canada China EU28 India US  Source Compiled by the authors based on Crunchbase (2018b).

In this case information from the World Bank one of the most relevant and largest data sources in the world were used. In particular the Global Financial Inclusion Database282 available both in microdata and in the DataBank online tool which  provides  over  800country  level  indicators  of  financial  inclusion  for  people  over 15 years  old  by  demographic  characteristics  such  as  age  gender  income  education  and rural residence. These variables refer to how people save borrow and make payments as well as how many people have an account or use financial services such as credit and debit cards. Downloaded data only included aggregated information from two waves 2014 and 2017. To compare European financial inclusion to other markets our dataset includes data from both  European  Union  (EU28)  countries  and  the  same  countries  selected  for  the  previous Crunchbase analysis i.e. Australia Canada China India Singapore and the US. DataBank provided  global  averages  of  variables.  In  that  way  we  were  also  able  to  elaborate  EU averages of all indicators for worldwide comparison. Time series were not always available in the data set; as a result some indicators are only available for one wave of the survey while others are available for both years. Among all financial inclusion indicators the analysis focused on the percentage of individuals who have an account at a bank or financial institution and the percentage of those who have a credit or debit card. We also selected variables that measured habits such as borrowing money in the last year borrowing money from a financial institution or a private informal lender  and  using  a  credit  card  in  the  past  year.  We  analysed  how  many  people  make transactions  using  a  mobile  phone  and  the  penetration  of  ATMs  and  Commercial  bank branches per 100 000 adults in each region or country.  ANNEX III.

Some factors can result in anticompetitive behaviours namely the network effects derived from the use of online platforms the access to customer data standardisation interoperability and the use of algorithms.  Combined  with  a  servicebyservice  analysis  the  study  provides  both  descriptive analysis and normative tools to anticipate and manage anticompetitive behaviours as they occur.
