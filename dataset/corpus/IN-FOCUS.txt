UNCTAD  Mauritius driving Quality Investments in Africa       The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)  World  Investment  Report  2019  highlights  the important role played by Mauritius in intraregional investment flows.   Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) stock from India Malaysia Singapore South Africa and Thailand to Small Island Developing  States  (SIDS)  is  almost  all  concentrated  in Mauritius as a gateway to other African markets.  Mauritius as a rapidly evolving International Finance Centre (IFC)  has  greatly  contributed  to  the  $46bn  worth  of  FDI flowing  into Africa  in 2018  an  11  %  increase compared  to 2017.    As  the  first  African  country  to  set  up  an  Export Processing  Zone  (EPZ)  in  the  1970s  Mauritius  recently introduced a fiveyear tax holiday for companies collaborating in  developing  infrastructure  in  Special  Economic  Zones (SEZs) on the African Continent. In fact Mauritius is actively participating  in  the  development  of  the  continent  through SEZs in countries like Angola and Senegal.    The  aim  is  to  create  an  economic  environment  conducive for local operators to explore business opportunities as well as to  develop  business  corridors  to  increase  the  demand  for Mauritian  products  and  share  Mauritius     experience  in  zone development. Mauritius is committed to expand its economic horizons  to  deepen  economic  diversification  in  partnership with other African countries.  To further diversify the product base of the IFC an umbrella licence  for  wealth  management  activities  a  scheme  for headquartering     ecommerce     activities  and  a  framework  for Green Finance are also being introduced. Mauritius as an IFC of substance and good repute is bringing a new dynamism to the global financial landscape.   The  Mauritius  IFC  has  diversified  as  a  financial  ecosystem providing a wide range of products and services of interest to investors  in  Africa  such  as  investment  banking  global  legal advisory  services  global  headquarters  administration  global treasury activities overseas family offices and asset and fund management schemes.  The Mauritius IFC is rated as fully compliant with the OECD standards on transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes and in the ESAAMLG Follow Up report in May 2019  successfully  obtained  an  upgrade  of  11  FATF recommendations  demonstrating  significant  progress in meeting technical compliance.  Considered  as  a  highly  compliant  jurisdiction  according  to international best practices the Mauritius IFC has been ranked first in Africa in the World Bank Doing Business Index Global Competitiveness Index and Forbes Survey of Best Countries for Business.    2   Page  500 Participants for Awareness Programme on Financial Literacy Finance InFocus                 ISSUE 10.

This  is  in  line  with  the  initiative  of  the     Nation  des Investisseurs     programme  launched  by  the  Ministry  of Financial Services and Good Governance. The objective of this initiative is to make Mauritius a high income country by disseminating  information  on  available  financial  products and  services  and  informing  the  public  on  consumer protection mechanisms.

Finance InFocus                 ISSUE 10.   Michal Szymanski    Fintech is all about innovation disruption and transformation and will undoubtedly impact and shape the way we do business in Mauritius     In line with the vision to create a thriving Fintech ecosystem the Mauritius Africa Fintech Hub (MAFH) a notforprofit organization was created in December  2018.  MAFH  is  supported  by  the  Mauritian  government regulatory  authorities  and financial  service  providers  both  big  and  small. Michal Szymanski a seasoned veteran in the business incubation space is the  CEO  of  MAFH  whose  team  is  now  actively  preparing  a  tech  hub environment ready to provide help to investors corporations academia and entrepreneurs to harness the growth potential of Fintech. He shares with us his vision on the future of Fintech in the Mauritian and African context.  What are the other key drivers in the development of an enabling framework for Fintech Firms? Amongst the key drivers it is of capital importance to have an agile and flexible regulatory framework that allows for quick turnaround  times  on  both  the  application  process  for  the licence along with constant iterations of current regulation to allow these innovations to thrive in the future. Moreover the creation of agile content and curriculum is equally important in collaboration with universities and training institutions to empower youth with the right skills for the global marketplace. In addition we should have the Government   s commitment to provide a fertile ground for Fintech innovations and skills to flourish and also a favorable tax environment that allows the  youth  and  startups  to  easily  raise  finance  for  their innovations and ventures.  How do you think Fintech will help our young entrepreneurs and fresh graduates?   With increasing unemployment on the African continent we  need to ensure that the youth of today are empowered with the right tools to take control of their future. This requires a mind  shift  from  looking  for  long  term  stable  jobs  to  the reality that the work place is now a changing dynamic and fluid environment. Fintech skills and innovations are in great demand  globally  to  solve  the  challenges  that  face  society today.  By empowering our youth with the technical expertise parallel with  personal  development  (such  as  critical  thinking)  and hands on practical experience we will not only provide more job opportunities for university leavers (in the global market) but also promote the creation of startups and innovations that could be scaled globally.  What are the other key drivers in the development of an enabling framework for Fintech Firms?  Firstly we must recognize that Mauritius has a very good and  robust that  has accompanied the country towards growth and success over the past  decades.    However  a  number  of  our  regulations  and legislation are dated like for instance the Companies Act 2001. There  should  be  an  actualization  of  all  legislation  and regulations so that the adoption of Fintech solutions is fully integrated. We should review our current KYC regulation to allow  for  greater  productivity  transparency  and  efficiency across all sectors and industries. The bottom line is that we should  start  thinking  of  easing  these  restrictions  for everybody.  Laws and regulations should exist to ensure compliance and good governance and should not hinder the development of the  Mauritius  Fintech  sector.  Being  an  island  nation  our unique selling proposition (USP) should be our ability to be agile across everything we do in order to be able to compete on a global stage. Fintech is all about innovation disruption and transformation and will undoubtedly impact and shape the way we do business in Mauritius and elsewhere thereby creating opportunities for both industry incumbents and new players.  legal/regulatory framework in  place 4   Page     NPCC Promotes Creative and Innovative Thinking  The  InnovEd  Award  Ceremony  was  recently  held  at  Rajiv  Gandhi Science Centre Pailles on 11 July 2019. Organized by the  NPCC  the  competition  was  to  reward  the  creative  and  innovative thinking of talented youngsters. Since  its  inception  in  2000  the  NPCC  has  been  promoting innovation at all levels     individual corporate and national as a main driver of productivity growth and competitiveness.  In a  fastchanging  global  economy  we  have  to  move  from education for survival to education for innovation leading to entrepreneurship and employability.

Government has subsequently set up a Technical Committee led by the Ministry of Financial Services and  Good  Governance appropriate recommendations on the system. The  Technical  Committee  is  looking  into  the  intricacies  of developing the proposed insurance system and its legal social financial and institutional implications amongst others and to make recommendations accordingly. In simple terms the Bonus Malus system is a rating process of deciding on an appropriate level of premium for a particular class of insurance business. It aims at empowering the insured by rewarding financially    good drivers    that is those who are not  involved  in  causing  accidents  and  penalising  the     bad drivers   .  The  underlying  principle  of  the  proposed  BonusManus system is that the higher the claim frequency of a policy holder  the  higher  the  insurance  costs  charged  to  the policyholder. Likewise if no claim is made in the previous year a discount in the premium will be given on the renewal of the policy.  In line with the National Road Safety Strategy the proposed BonusMalus  system  is  intended  to  reduce  the  number  of casualties on our roads and encourage safer driving. Additionally  this  new  system  is  expected  to  put  an  end  to fraudulent practices as well as improve the work processes and business  operations  of  the insurance  companies.  Most countries have now introduced meritrating or Bonus Malus systems  (BMS)  in  third  party  liability  automobile  insurance rating. Such systems penalise by surcharges     6   Page and reward claimfree years by discounts. In a free market carriers  need  to  use  a  rating  structure  that  matches  the premiums to the risks as closely as possible or at least as closely as the rating structures used by competitors.  This  entails  using  virtually  every  available  classification variable correlated to the risks since failing to do so would mean sacrificing the chance to select against competitors and  incurring  the  risk  of  suffering  adverse  selection  by them.  Therefore  the  use  of  more  a  priori  classification variables  is  expected  in  free  market  countries  which decreases the need for a sophisticated BMS.  The regulatory environments in Asian and European countries are extremely diversified from total freedom (like in the U.K. where  each  insurer  is  free  to  design  its  own  BMS)  to governmentimposed  systems  (like  in  Switzerland  where  all companies have to use the same BMS) with many intermediate situations (Denmark for instance where insurers apply BMS rules quite loosely). Obviously the approach to bonusmalus design  depends  on  regulation.  If  a  tariff  is  imposed  by  the government  and  every  insurer  has  to  use  it  there  is  no commercial pressure to match the premiums to the risks by making use of every available relevant information.       FSI trains young graduates on Compliance            Finance InFocus                 ISSUE 10.
