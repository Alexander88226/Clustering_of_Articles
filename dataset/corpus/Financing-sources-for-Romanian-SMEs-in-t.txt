The resources available to SMEs are always limited and insufficient for their development  potential.  Therefore  the  study  aims  to  identify  the  financing  sources  for  Romanian SMEs to quantify in what measure they apply to this financing sources and what is their trend. In order to present the actual financing sources for SMEs in Romania we used 3 methods. First we conducted  an  interview  addressed  to  Romanian  entrepreneurs  in  order  to  identify  the  financing sources to which they call on most frequently. Secondly we conducted a quantitative study in order to quantify the number of entrepreneurs that appeals to each of the identified sources. Thirdly we compared the results from the past five years (2011 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2015) in order to observe the trend. Approximately 82.04% of Romanian SMEs under questioning finance their economic activities out of own  sources  and  only  24.58%  of  them  use  the  bank  credit  for  financing.  Although  there  is  a  great range  of  funding  sources  very  few  entrepreneurs  use  other  sources  than  the  classic  ones  selffinancing and bank credit. There are significant numbers of SMEs that could use funds productively if they were available but cannot obtain finance from the formal financial system.

INTRODUCTION  Given  the  current  context  of  the  increasing  development  of  knowledgebased  economic  activities as  well  as  the  European  Union  integration  context  this  article  aims  to  highlight  the  financing sources for SMEs and their evolution over the past five years. Most of the businesses are represented by SMEs which have a very important role in any country fulfilling  multiple  economic  technical  and  social  functions.  They  are  a  source  of  entrepreneurial skills  innovation  and  job  creation.  In  EU  approximately  23  million  SMEs  provide  around  75 million jobs and represent 99% of all businesses. Although the SMEs have such an importance to the economy we believe that their interests are not sufficiently taken into account by the decision factors from their field. However in Romania there are some organisations like  National  Council for Small  and Medium Sized Private Enterprises in Romania which defend and represent the SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interests. One of the main problems that SMEs  are facing is the access to finance. Financial institutions are reserved  when  it  comes  to  financing  because  of  the  lack  of  information  about  SMEs  and entrepreneurs because of their high vulnerability to market risks and limited assets that can be used as collateral.                                                  1 The Bucharest University of Economic Studies Romania uritu.daniel@gmail.com 2 The Bucharest University of Economic Studies Romania alexandrue.popa@gmail.com 590\\x0cPROCEEDINGS OF THE 9th INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE  "Management and Innovation For Competitive Advantage" November 5th6th 2015 BUCHAREST ROMANIA The studies show that SMEs are facing more obstacles in their development than large enterprises and the access to the financing sources in one the major obstacles identified (Ayyagari et al 2006). Therefore  this  study  aims  to  identify  which  are  the  most  important  sources  of  financing  for  the SMEs  in  Romania  in  what  measure  the  entrepreneurs  use  these  sources  and  which  is  the  trend taking into account the evolution of SMEs financing in the last five years.  2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND  Knowledgebased economy is a common concept when we talk about global economic trends. This is due to the importance  given to knowledge and bringing them to the forefront  for the operation  and development of enterprises. In  the  XXI  century  the  basic  resources  are  no  longer  capital  physical  work  and  the  land    the predominant  physical  factors  of  the  industrial  revolution  but  intangible  intellectual  resources knowledge. Knowledge is now recognized as the driver of productivity and economic growth leading to a new focus on the role of information technology and learning in economic performance. It  has  been  reported  that  the  initial  foundation  for  the  Knowledge  Economy  was  first  introduced  in 1966 in the book The Effective Executive by Peter Drucker. Drucker describes the difference between the manual worker and the knowledge worker. The manual worker according to him works with his hands and produces good or services but a knowledge worker works with his or her head not hands and produces ideas knowledge and information. Jones A. B.  considers that  knowledge based economy represents  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe fundamental  changing  from the  economy  based  primordially  on  the  physical  resources  to  the  economy  based  primordially  on knowledge\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The  specialists\\xe2\\x80\\x99  opinions  regarding  the  definition  of  the  knowledge  based  economy  or  new economy  are  different  from  one  to  another.  Nicolescu  O.  synthesizing  the  definitions  from  the specialized  literature  considers  that  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe  knowledge  based  economy  is  characterized  by  the transformation of the knowledge in base material capital products production factors essentials for the economy and through economic processes in which the generation selling acquisition learning stocking developing splitting and protection of the knowledge became predominant  and decisive for the profit obtaining and for the assurance of the economic sustainability on the long term\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In the knowledgebased economy the specialized labor force is  characterized as computer literate and welltrained in handling data developing algorithms and simulated models and innovating on processes  and  systems.  Harvard  Business  School  Professor  Michael  Porter  asserts  that  today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy  is  far  more  dynamic  and  that  comparative  advantage  is  less  relevant  than  competitive advantage  which  rests  on  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmaking  more  productive  use  of  inputs  which  requires  continual innovation. In  this  context  of  knowledge  based  economy  one  of  the  main  problems  that  SMEs  are  facing remains the access to financing. The current crisis in the financial sector around the world has made such access even more critical. In order to measure the extend in which EU firms accessing diverse financing sources assessing the extent  to  which  companies  face  difficulties  in  access  to  finance  and  to  study  the  expectations  of companies  regarding  financing  their  future  projects  from  the  European  Commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  order (General Directorate for Enterprise and Industry) in collaboration with the European Central Bank have  been  undertaken  a  number  of  research  contained  in  Flash  Eurobarometer  Access  to  Finance (No. 271). According to  researches one of the  most pressing concerns  of  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 managers in  the EU  is  the  access  to  finance  (European  Central  Bank  in  2009  Gallup  Organization  2009)  this problem generates more than 16 % of the options (Daniel Badulescu 2010).

METHODOLOGY  In order to present the actual financing sources for SMEs in Romania we used 3 methods. First we conducted  an  interview  addressed  to  Romanian  entrepreneurs  in  order  to  identify  the  financing sources to which they call on most frequently. Secondly we conducted a quantitative study in order to quantify the number of entrepreneurs that appeals to each of the identified sources. Thirdly we compared the results from the past five years (2011 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2015) in order to observe the trends.  3.1. Qualitative research  interview Qualitative research is exploratory and involves interviewing a small number of individuals and the data are not statistically representative for the population studied. The qualitative research is used to achieve  richer  data  in  content  and  profundity.  Qualitative  research  has  methods  techniques  and research tools adapted to the studied problem\\xe2\\x80\\x99s specific. An  interview  is  a  conversation  between  two  or  more  people  where  questions  are  asked  by  the interviewer  to  elicit  facts  or  statements  from  the  interviewee.  The  qualitative  research  interview seeks to describe and the meanings of central themes in the life world of the subjects.

Interviewing  when considered  as  a  method  for  conducting  qualitative  research  is  a  technique  used  to  understand  the experiences of others.  3.2. Quantitative research Quantitative  research  is  the  systematic  empirical  investigation  of  observable  phenomena  via statistical  mathematical  or  computational  techniques.  The  objective  of  quantitative  research  is  to develop  and  employ  mathematical  theories  and/or  hypotheses  pertaining  to  phenomena.  The process  of  measurement  is  central  to  quantitative  research  because  it  provides  the  fundamental connection  between  empirical  observation  and  mathematical  expression  of  quantitative relationships. Quantitative data is any data that is in numerical form such as statistics percentages etc.  3.3. Data analysis Analysis of data is a process of inspecting cleaning transforming and modeling data with the goal of  discovering  useful  information  suggesting  conclusions  and  supporting  decisionmaking.  Data analysis  has  multiple  facets  and  approaches  encompassing  diverse  techniques  under  a  variety  of names in different business science and social science domains.  4. RESULTS  4.1. Financing sources for the SMEs Development of the knowledge and information based society led to the diversification of financing sources available for the enterprises to run their business and for developing.  Given  the  results  of  the  qualitative  study  the  most  common  sources  of  financing  indicated  by entrepreneurs as the sources they used in last years are selffinancing bank loans supplier credit and leasing. There were also indicated other sources of financing such as non \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reimbursable funds loans from  specialized  financial  institutions  customer  credit  nonpayment  of  the  bills  guaranty  from  the NCGFSME emission of shares on the capital market and factoring but in a much smaller measure. Taking into account that the results of the quantitative study show that calling on for such sources is very  rare  because  of  the  difficult  access  of  SMEs  to  these  financing  sources  or  low  interest  of  the entrepreneurs for them we introduced those in other sources category.  4.2. Romanian SMEs financing Hereafter we present the results of quantitative research about the sources of financing for SMEs in the last year. The results are based on the responses of 1375 entrepreneurs and managers of SMEs in all development regions of Romania. Given  that  SMEs  surveyed  come  from  all  regions  of  Romania  that  they  are  from  all  branches  of activity  age  groups  and  are  micro  small  and  mediumsized  and  considering  the  large  number  of questionnaires we consider this sample representative for the research\\xe2\\x80\\x99s purpose. Whereas  the  finance  sources  for  economic  activities  that  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  entrepreneurs/managers  called upon in the last year our study results show the following aspects 82.04% of the companies have used self \\xe2\\x80\\x93 finance 24.58% of the companies have got bank credits 18.33% of SMEs have used a suppliers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 credit 3.85% of the enterprises have used the leasing 1.82% of the enterprises have used non  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  reimbursable  funds  1.53%  have  used  loans  from  specialized  institutions  and  1.45%  have used customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credits as a source of finance. See figure no. 3 At the same time we also notice the fact that 0.44% have used the guaranteeing under the National Credit Guarantee Fund for SMEs; the companies under investigation have used to a smaller extent other forms of finance such as customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credits the emission of shares factoring etc. 593\\x0cPROCEEDINGS OF THE 9th INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE  "Management and Innovation For Competitive Advantage" November 5th6th 2015 BUCHAREST ROMANIA Figure 3.

SMEs financing trends Given  the  diversification  of  the  financing  sources  for  SMEs  in  Romania  in  the  context  of  the knowledge based economy in Figure 4 we observe the trend of entrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 calling on from these sources.  This  is  given  by  the  entrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  preference  and  by  the  degree  of  difficulty  obtaining financing. In  Figure  4  we  can  see  an  increasing  trend  in  the  past  5  years  for  the  SMEs  that  are  using  selffinancing. Fewer SMEs apply to bank loans in order to finance their activities their rate decreasing from  41.39%  in  2011  to  24.58%  in  2015.  The  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  rate  that  appeals  to  leasing  decreased considerably  from  14.61%  in  2011  to  3.85%  in  2015.  The  number  of  entrepreneurs  that  use supplier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit as a financing source is slightly increasing while the rate of those who seek other sources  of  financing  than  those  mentioned  is  around  the  10%  and  it  does  not  register  major differences from one year to another. The fact that SMEs have difficulties in accessing finance is increasingly important in the context of a  fast  changing  knowledgebased  economy  in  which  innovative  SMEs  with  high  growth  potential are  key  in  raising  productivity  and  in  maintaining  competitiveness.  The  ability  of  small  firms   particularly fastgrowth \'gazelles\'  to exploit investment opportunities is dependent on the extent to which lowcost external sources of financing are available.  595\\x0cPROCEEDINGS OF THE 9th INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE  "Management and Innovation For Competitive Advantage" November 5th6th 2015 BUCHAREST ROMANIA  Figure 4.

CONCLUSIONS  SMEs  are  the  basis  of  our  economy  and  we  must  encourage  them.  They  contribute  to  economic growth competitiveness entrepreneurship and innovation. The  access  to  the  capital  is  a  permanent  problem  that  SMEs  are  facing  especially  because  they cannot offer guarantees that creditors traditionally ask. Financing is necessary to help SMEs set up and expand their operations develop new products and invest in new staff or production facilities. Many small businesses start out as an idea from one or two persons who invest their own money and/or have financial help of family and friends in return for  a  share  in  the  business.  But  if  they  are  successful  they  need  new  investment  to  expand  or innovate further. At this point they often run into problems because they find it much harder than larger businesses to obtain financing from banks capital markets or other suppliers of credit. SMEs  are  the  fundament  of  economy  and  SMEs  are  vital  to  promoting  economic  growth competitiveness  entrepreneurship  and  innovation  and  to  creating  new  jobs.  Ensuring  adequate access to finance so that SMEs can grow and achieve their full potential is central to achieving the objectives of the renewed Lisbon partnership for growth and jobs. Approximately 82.04% of Romanian SMEs under questioning finance their economic activities out of own  sources.  This  can  be  interpreted  in  two  ways.  On  the  one  side  is  a  good  thing  because entrepreneurs reinvest profits earned therefore they trust the activity of SMEs and it is an indicator that they have a good chance of success. On the other hand if we correlate the number of SMEs that support themselves with the SMEs who seek external sources of financing we deduce that  most of them  use  selffinancing  as  the  only  source  of  funding.  This  represents  a  significant  barrier  to  the development of SMEs since they cannot explore their full potential only by selffinancing. 24.58%  of  SMEs  use  the  bank  credit  for  financing.  This  number  is  very  small  compared  to  the financing needs of enterprises. Analyzing the below  research several key  ideas  can be drawn  access to finance is one of the main problems of SMEs (just after "finding customers" but before "competition" or "availability of skilled staff or experienced managers"); in Romania SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to financing is more pronounced than the average  of  Europe;  although  there  is  a  great  range  of  funding  sources  very  few  entrepreneurs  use other sources than the classic ones selffinancing and bank credit; depending on the size or on their activity  field  SMEs  appeal  in  different  measure  to  different  financing  sources;  according  to  the evolutions  shown  in  Figure  4  the  SMEs  tend  to  finance  themselves  which  is  a  problem  both  for companies and for the economy. 69.8774.991.2791.5282.0441.3930.425.7522.4324.5816.5410.0318.332.932.363.859.496.99010203040506070809010020112012201320142015Self financeBank creditsSupplier\'s creditLeasingOther596\\x0cPROCEEDINGS OF THE 9th INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE  "Management and Innovation For Competitive Advantage" November 5th6th 2015 BUCHAREST ROMANIA There are significant numbers of SMEs that could use funds productively if they were available but cannot  obtain  finance  from  the  formal  financial  system.  The  financing  gap  affects  a  subset  of SMEs  such  as  innovative  firms  whose  technology  and  business  models  are  not  understood  by many  more  traditional  financial  institutions  and  startup  enterprises  and  very  young  firms  which lack a track record and collateral against which to raise debt finance. European  Union  and  even  Romania  provide  funding  for  SMEs  through  various  programs  and projects but there is a high bureaucracy and most entrepreneurs consider them still inaccessible as evidenced by the fact that most of these use selffinancing. This study is a very useful material for those interested in the subject of SME financing and funding sources  available.  Reusing  these  models  by  updating  the  data  can  create  an  overview  at  any  future moment. However the model has some limitations one of them being the particularity of Romanian SMEs. Another limitation may be the different interpretation in each country and region in which it is applied  This work can be used as a foundation for future researches by analyzing the factors that influence the selection of financing sources by entrepreneurs and managers.
